The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.
