      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.
