      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery.
