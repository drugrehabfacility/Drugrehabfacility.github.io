      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).
