      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process.
