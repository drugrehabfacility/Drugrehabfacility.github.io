      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else.
