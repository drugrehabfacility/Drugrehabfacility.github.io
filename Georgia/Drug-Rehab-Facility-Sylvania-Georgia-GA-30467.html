      These have been selected out as excellent detox and rehab centers despite their low costs Contact us for Detox and Withdrawal Assistance At Live-in Centers: 1-800-650-8776 Tibor Palatinus, the Drug Rehab Advisor, refers his clients to integrative medical detox facilities, when necessary. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment.
