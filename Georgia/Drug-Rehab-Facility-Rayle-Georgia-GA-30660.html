      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Search our directory of centers throughout the country or call 800-483-2193 to speak with a treatment specialist today! 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others.

      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. 
      If you need a snack, you can visit the cafe-style dining area. You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
