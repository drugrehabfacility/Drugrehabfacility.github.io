      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden.
