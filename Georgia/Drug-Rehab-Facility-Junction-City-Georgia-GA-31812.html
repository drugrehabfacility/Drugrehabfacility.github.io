      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Alcohol detox in Ohio can last as little as three or four days, or up to several weeks for those fighting a severe or long-term addiction. You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track.
