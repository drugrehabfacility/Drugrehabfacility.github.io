      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification.
