      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative. A growing number of drug treatment centers in Maryland have services for the hearing impaired.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
