      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are.
