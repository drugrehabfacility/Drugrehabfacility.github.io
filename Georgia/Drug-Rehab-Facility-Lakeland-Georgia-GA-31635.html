      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).
