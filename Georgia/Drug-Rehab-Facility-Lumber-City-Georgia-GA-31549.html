      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only.
