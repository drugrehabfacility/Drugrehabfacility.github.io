      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end.
