      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems.
