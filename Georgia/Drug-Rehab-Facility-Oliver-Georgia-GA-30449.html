      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use.
