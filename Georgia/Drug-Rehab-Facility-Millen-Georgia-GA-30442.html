      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. Please leave us your questions or comments about detox.

It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process.
