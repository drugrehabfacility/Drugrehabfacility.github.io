      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. Nevada is an anomaly when it comes to drug detox center admissions, though. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.
