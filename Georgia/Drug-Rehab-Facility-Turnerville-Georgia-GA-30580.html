      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications? During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.
