      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person.

      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. 
      Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
      This will make finding exactly what you need at the nearest drug detox center facility to your family.
