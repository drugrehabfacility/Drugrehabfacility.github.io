      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Alcohol detox in Ohio can last as little as three or four days, or up to several weeks for those fighting a severe or long-term addiction.Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures.
