      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms.

      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Glenbeigh, Niles (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today An affiliate of Cleveland Clinic, Glenbeigh is an alcohol and drug addiction treatment center staffed by licensed independent social workers, physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, certified chemical dependency counselors and clergy. Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? 
      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living.
