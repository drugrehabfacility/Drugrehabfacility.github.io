      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries.

      Red Rock Canyon is a great place to go hiking and climbing or you can head out to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam for tours and boating. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.
