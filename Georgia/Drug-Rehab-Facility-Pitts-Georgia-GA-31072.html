      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Known as the Buckeye State, Ohio has brought many great things to the United States.
