      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another.

      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake.

      Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible.
