      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.
