      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
