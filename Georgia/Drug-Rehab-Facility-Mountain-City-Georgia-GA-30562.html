      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Translation to English by Sergio Cadena 14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 3 months Ago Get to know our Emcee for this year's East Bay Center's 2nd Annual Gala Patrick Little of WPRI.com. 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients.
