      additional Information on duluth alcohol and drug treatment center 
      Centerville Georgia GA 31028
    </h3>
    <p>
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.

      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.
