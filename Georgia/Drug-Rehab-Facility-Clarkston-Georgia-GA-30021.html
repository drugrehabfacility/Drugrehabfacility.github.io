      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program.
