      Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death.

If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something.
