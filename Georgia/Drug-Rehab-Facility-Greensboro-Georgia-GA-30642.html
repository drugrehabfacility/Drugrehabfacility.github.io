      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. At these meetings, you'll find the loving support of women and men that are currently fighting with similar difficulties and discover how they've learned to look after themselves. 
      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program.
