      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.

Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
