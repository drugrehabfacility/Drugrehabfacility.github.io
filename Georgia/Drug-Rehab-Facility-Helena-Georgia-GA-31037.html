      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
