      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
