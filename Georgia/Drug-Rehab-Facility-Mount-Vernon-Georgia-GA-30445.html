      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. They are searching for the same high that the pills gave them. 
      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
