      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use.
