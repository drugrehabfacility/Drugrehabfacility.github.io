      Illinois & Drug Abuse Alcoholism is a sneaky illness. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. RehabCenter.net offers free information about Ohio’s residential rehab programs. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
