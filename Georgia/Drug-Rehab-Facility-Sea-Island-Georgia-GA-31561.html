(AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Do they accept private pay or offer payment plans or loans? 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.
