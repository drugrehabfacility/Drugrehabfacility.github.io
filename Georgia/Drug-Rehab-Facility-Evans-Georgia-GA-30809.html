      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Professional detox centers in Maryland: Alleviate physical symptoms Ease cravings Keep patients medically stable Simultaneously treat co-occurring conditions that impact withdrawal Offer support in recovery Help patients transfer into a rehab facility Entering one of these programs will provide you with the best foundation for continued recovery. 
      In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.

      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. 
      31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs.
