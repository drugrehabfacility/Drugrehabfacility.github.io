      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.

      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal.

      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using.
