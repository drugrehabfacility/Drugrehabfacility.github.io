      Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab.
