      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Your doctor did not tell you how addictive benzos would be. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far.
