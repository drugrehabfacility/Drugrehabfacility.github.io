      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. Each person who has to go through the detox facilities in Washington just wants someone who cares while also somehow managing to beat the discomfort of the physical withdrawal from opiates, benzos, alcohol, cocaine and more. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7.
