      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
