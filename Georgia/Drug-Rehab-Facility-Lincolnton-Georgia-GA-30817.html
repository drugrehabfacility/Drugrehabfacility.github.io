      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context.
