      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Practicing kindness is as simple as helping the someone take groceries to the car. Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful. 
      Partial hospitalization: This treatment program best applies to patients who require a continuous medical Fairview UT 84629 monitoring, but who are not very affected by the drug abuse problem.
