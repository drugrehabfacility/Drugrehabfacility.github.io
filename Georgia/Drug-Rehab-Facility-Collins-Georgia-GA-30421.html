      We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
