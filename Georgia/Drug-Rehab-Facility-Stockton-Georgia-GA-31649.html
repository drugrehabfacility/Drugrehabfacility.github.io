      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.

      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant.

      Our goal is to help you break your chemical dependency as a safely and as comfortable as possible. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
