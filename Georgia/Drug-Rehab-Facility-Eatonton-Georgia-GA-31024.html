      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
