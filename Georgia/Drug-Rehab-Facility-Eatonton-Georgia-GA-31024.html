      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.

      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. 
      Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. 
      We will then go over the best plan as to get you enrolled in that facility. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive.

      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.Loans: Many treatment centers provide financing, and there are even specialty loan companies specifically for the purpose of funding treatment for individuals. 
      Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program.
