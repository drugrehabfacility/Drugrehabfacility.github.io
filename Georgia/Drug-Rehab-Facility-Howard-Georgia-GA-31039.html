      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body.

      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities.
