The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Counseling is also provided by the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts.
