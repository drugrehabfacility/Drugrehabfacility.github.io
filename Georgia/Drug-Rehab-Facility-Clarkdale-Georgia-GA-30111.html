      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.
