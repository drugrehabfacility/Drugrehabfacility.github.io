      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable.

      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction.The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history.

      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete.Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.

      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked.
