      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      The 38-acre property provides an attractive setting for recovery and contemplation, including comfortable and comforting rooms, a full gymnasium, and beautiful natural surroundings. The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. 
      It also gives him a chance to discuss privately those items which he may not be prepared to discuss in front of a group. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.
