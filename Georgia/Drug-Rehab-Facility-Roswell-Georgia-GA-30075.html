      5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Detoxifying from opioid dependency: Withdrawal from heroin and opioid painkillers can come with very powerful symptoms that begin within six hours of quitting. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Let us help find the right treatment center for you, so you can start living a better life.
