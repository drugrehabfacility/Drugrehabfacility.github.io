      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
