When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief.

      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.

      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.

Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
