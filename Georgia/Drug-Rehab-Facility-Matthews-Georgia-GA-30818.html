      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.
