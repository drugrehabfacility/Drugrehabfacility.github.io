      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. To them, everyone should already know the dangers of drugs and that, if you use them, you are a character of low morality and willpower whose principles need a lot of work.
