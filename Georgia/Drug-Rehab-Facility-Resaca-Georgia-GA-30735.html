      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county.

      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use.Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
