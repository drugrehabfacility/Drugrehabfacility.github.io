      Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
