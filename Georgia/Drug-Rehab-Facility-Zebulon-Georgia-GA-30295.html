      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
