      1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). 
      Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.

      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month. The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification.

      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. One simply need to follow recommendations for a smooth detox. 
      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to.
