      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. 
      Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox. 
      Drug is a thing that does not choose a man, it can turn everyone into a drug addict.Our Medical Detox Centers Are High Class Facilities Our program is a blend of medical treatment as well as treatment through the use of vitamins, nutrition, and meditation.There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. 
      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
