      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance.

      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track.
