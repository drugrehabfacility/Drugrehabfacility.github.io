      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use.
