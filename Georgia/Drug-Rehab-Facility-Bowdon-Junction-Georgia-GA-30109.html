      Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health. 
      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms.

      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.

The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
