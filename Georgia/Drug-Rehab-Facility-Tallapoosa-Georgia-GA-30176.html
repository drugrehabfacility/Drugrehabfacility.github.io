      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
