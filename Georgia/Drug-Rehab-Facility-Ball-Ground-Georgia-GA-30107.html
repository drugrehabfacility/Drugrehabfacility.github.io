      Follow is a list of the common benefits and disadvantages of inpatient and outpatient detox. 
      Opiate detox centers specialize in helping patients who are addicted to opiates and can provide profound treatment measures to assist the recovering addict in their plight against opiate addiction. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. 
      They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
