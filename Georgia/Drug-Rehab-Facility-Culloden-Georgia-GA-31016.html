      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. 
      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.

      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Some of these dangers can include seizures and even death.

      You will get numerous diverse answers on how to avoid relapse such as; staying positive, going to meeting or groups and staying associated to your peers. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.
