The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process.
