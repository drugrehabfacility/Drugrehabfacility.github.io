      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Alcohol treatment and addiction recovery are possible through the right treatment facility.All over the United States, drug abuse or heroin abuse are still increasing, that’s why the program of Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts still fights the prevention of addiction. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.
