      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Don’t fall victim to this statistic, call 800-483-2193 today and we’ll connect you with a detox specialist that can answer your questions and help you find a center that’s able to assist in your recovery process.

      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      If you are in need of immediate assistance, please call our toll-free number and we will help you 24 hours a day 7 days a week. IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body. 
      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction.
