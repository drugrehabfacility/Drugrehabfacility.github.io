      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there.

      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.
