      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. For a complete list of items we provide and items you should bring, please contact our Admissions team. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
