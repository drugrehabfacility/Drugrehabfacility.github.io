      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
