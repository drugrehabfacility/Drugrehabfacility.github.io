One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Our experts in drug detox in Howell often see how lack of knowledge is able to get in the way when people struggle with addiction.  It’s important to learn how addiction happens, and how drug detox works. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there.
