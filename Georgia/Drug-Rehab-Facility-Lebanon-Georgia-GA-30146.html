The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.
