      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Do they accept private pay or offer payment plans or loans? 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture!

      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.
