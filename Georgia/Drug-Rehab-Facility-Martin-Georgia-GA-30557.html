      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. 
      Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs?

      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.

      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
