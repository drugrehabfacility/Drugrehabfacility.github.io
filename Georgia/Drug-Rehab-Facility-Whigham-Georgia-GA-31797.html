      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? 
      Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety. We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.
