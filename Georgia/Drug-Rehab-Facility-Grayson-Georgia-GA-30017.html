      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. While less common, cocaine, sedatives, and hallucinogens were also reasons for seeking out drug treatment in Nevada. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.
