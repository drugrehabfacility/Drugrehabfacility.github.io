      Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
