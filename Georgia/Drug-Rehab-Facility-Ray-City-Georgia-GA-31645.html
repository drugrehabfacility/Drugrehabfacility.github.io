      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Medical monitoring –Detox patients rest in well-furnished private rooms outfitted with monitoring equipment. But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun.
