      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. 
      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with.

      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
