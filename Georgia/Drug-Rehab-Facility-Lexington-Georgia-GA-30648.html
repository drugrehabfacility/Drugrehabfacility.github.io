      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Call now for more information on drug abuse or addiction.
