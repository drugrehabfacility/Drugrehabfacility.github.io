It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.

      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify.
