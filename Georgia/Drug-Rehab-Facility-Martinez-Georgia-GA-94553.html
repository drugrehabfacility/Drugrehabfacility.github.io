It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual.
