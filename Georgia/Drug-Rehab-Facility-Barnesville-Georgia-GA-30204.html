      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 
      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers.
