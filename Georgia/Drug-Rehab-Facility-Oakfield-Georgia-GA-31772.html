      For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      At these meetings, you'll find the loving support of women and men that are currently fighting with similar difficulties and discover how they've learned to look after themselves. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
