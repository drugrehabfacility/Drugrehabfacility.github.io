      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully.
