      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox?

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system.
