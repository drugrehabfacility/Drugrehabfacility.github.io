      Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.

      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      If you’re looking for help in Bloomington, Chicago, or Rockford, local Illinois detox centers are found in abundance offering access to the treatment necessary to fuel recovery. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process.
