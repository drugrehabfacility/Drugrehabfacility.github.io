      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage.

      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications.

      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. If you’re looking for help in Bloomington, Chicago, or Rockford, local Illinois detox centers are found in abundance offering access to the treatment necessary to fuel recovery. 
      The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.

Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services.

      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option.Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.

The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions.

      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.
