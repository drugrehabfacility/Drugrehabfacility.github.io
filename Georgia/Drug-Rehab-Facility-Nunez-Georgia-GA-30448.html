      An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that. 
      Opiate addiction is killing thousands of people every year. Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. Prove your husband the issues you will need to face due to his drinking issue.
