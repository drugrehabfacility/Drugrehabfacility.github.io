      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Bar none, Detox of South Florida is the best care I have received. 
      Medication Assisted Detox - Drug Detox Centers Medication assisted detox is a common form of drug detox.

      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal.

      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.

      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks.Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.
