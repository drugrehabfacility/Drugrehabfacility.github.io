      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit.

      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown.
