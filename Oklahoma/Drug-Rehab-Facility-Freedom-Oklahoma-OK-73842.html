      You’re in good hands with our compassionate, expertly trained medical teams. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. You require help too if you are one of those four. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
