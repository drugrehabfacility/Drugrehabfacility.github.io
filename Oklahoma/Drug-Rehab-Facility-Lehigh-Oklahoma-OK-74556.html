      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals.
