      Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better.
