      These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. 
      Opiate addiction is killing thousands of people every year.
