      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. 
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.
