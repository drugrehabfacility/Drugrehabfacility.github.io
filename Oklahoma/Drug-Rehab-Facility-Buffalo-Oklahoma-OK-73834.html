      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse.

Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it.
