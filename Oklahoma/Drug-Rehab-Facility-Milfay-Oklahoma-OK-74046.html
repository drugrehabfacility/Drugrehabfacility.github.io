      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. 115 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday! 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
