      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.

      5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
