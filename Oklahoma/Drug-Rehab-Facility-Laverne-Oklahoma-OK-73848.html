      S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day.
