    <p>
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. 
      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      Smiling is considered infectious, so keep on smiling! Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so.
