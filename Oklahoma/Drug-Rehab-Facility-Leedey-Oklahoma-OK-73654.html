Detox in NJ, especially for alcohol abusers, can take fluctuating amounts of time.

      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. 
      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
