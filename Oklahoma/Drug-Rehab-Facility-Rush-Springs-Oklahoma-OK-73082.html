      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender.
