      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      New Hope Recovery Center, Chicago (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today New Hope Recovery Center’s core values state that they want to provide compassion and treat clients with dignity and worth, and when you look at the rave reviews from former clients, it is easy to see that they are succeeding in doing just that. The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.
