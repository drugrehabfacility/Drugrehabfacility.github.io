      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Detox Withdrawal Advice We help you find a truly effective alcohol or benzo detox and rehab. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body.

      Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try.

      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.

      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well.
