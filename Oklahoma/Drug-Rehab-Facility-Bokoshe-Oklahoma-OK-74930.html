      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow.
