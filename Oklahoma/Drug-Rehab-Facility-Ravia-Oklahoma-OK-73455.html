      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
