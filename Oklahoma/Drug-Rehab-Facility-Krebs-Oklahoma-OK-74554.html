      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
