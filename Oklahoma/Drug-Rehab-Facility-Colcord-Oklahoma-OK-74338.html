      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
