      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      Patients are given sedation if needed and IV vitamin infusions. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      Types of Treatment Available Drug rehabilitation is addressed through various Fairview UT 84629 programs which include; use of local support groups, addiction counseling, medical care, residential treatment, extended care givers, mental health, recovery houses and orthomolecular medicine.
