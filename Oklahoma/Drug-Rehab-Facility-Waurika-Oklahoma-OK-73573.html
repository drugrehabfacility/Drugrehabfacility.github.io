      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.August 23, 2017 by Mark Adams Learn More about the Available Miami Lakes Drug Detox Facilities Drug and alcohol addiction may seem like a simple, catch-all term for anyone who has a substance abuse problem but there are many intricacies to each individual’s fight with their dangerous and debilitating habit. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.

      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. It does not have sympathy for any one race, gender, nation or background. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die.
