      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse.

      It is always advisable to inquire about scholarships or grants available for low-income individuals when seeking a treatment center.Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems.

      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.

Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.

      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
