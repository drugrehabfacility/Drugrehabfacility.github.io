      A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. You’ll enjoy comfortable furnishings and warm décor in soothing settings. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful.
