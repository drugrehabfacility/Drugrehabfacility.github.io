      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.

    <p>
      Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment.If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      But in recent decades, Ohio’s has shifted from a manufacturing to service economy, causing much unemployment and economic upheaval.

      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible.
