      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.

      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms.

      I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager.

    <p>
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms.
