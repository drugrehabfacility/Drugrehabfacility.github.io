      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment.
