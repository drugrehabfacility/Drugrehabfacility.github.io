      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
