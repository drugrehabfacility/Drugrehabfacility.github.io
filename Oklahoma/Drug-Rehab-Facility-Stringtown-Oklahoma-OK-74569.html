      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Our experts in drug detox in Howell often see how lack of knowledge is able to get in the way when people struggle with addiction.  It’s important to learn how addiction happens, and how drug detox works. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.
