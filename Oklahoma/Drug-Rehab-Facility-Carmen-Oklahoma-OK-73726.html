      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment.

      Simply put, the treatment program uses different disciplines with planning and purpose. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
