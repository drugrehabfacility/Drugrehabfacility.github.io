      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety. If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox.
