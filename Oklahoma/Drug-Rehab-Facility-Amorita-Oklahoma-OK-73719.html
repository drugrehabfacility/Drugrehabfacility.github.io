      One simply need to follow recommendations for a smooth detox. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.
