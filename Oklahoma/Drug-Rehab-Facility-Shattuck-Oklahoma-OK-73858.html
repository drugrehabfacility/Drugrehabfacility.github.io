      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you.
