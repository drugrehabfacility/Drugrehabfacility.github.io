      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
