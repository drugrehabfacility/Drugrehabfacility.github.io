      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program.
