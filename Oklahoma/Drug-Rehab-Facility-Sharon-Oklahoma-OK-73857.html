      Medications that Help Addiction treatment has come a long way, and inpatient drug detox centers have a variety of different medications that they can use to help people deal with withdrawal. I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.

      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Skilled and continuous assessment of medical needs during the detoxification process, and rock solid procedures for dealing with any sort of medical emergency that may occur. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.
