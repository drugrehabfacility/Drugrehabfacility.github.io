      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Getting the right detox withdrawal advice will save your life. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.

      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.
