      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      Those detoxing can also become dependent on these drugs and start abusing them. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process.
