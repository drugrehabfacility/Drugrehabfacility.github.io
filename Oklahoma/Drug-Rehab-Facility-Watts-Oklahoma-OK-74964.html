      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal.

      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox.
