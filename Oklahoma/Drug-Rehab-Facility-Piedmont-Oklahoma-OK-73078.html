      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      This is an important part of addiction treatment. The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process.

      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.
