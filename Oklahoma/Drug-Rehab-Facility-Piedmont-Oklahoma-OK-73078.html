      1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less. (AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
