IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable.

      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time.
