      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly. For free confidential advice on choosing the best detox centers @cta.
