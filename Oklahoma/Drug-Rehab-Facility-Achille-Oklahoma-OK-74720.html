      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse.

      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.
