      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"...One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment.
