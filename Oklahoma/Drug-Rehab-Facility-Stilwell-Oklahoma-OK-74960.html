      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. You’ll enjoy comfortable furnishings and warm décor in soothing settings. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
