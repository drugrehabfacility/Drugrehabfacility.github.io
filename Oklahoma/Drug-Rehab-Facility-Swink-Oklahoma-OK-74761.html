      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. 
      The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
