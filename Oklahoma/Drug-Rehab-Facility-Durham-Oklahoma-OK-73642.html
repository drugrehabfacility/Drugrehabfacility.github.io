      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on.
