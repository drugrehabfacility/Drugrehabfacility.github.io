      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free. Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      We can help you find a rehab that is best for you.
