      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Detox facilities all over the country are not created equal that is why detox facilities in Washington give one of the most comfortable and home like experiences for each client that needs to separate themselves from their drug use and drinking. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470.
