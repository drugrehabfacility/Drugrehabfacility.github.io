      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.Home Drug Detox Drug Detox Programs Drug Detox Programs Many different drug detox programs exist to provide patients with the best possible drug detoxification and care for their individual needs.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time.

      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction. Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
