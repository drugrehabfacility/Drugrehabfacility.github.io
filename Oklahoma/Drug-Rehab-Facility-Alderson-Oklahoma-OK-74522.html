It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
