      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all.
