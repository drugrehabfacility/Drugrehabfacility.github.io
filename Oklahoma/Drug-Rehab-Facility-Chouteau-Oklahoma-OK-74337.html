      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. If Roger Ebert was still alive, he would give Detox of South Florida two thumbs up! 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
