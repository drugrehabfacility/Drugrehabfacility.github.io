      There are priority populations in many state rehab centers. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world.
