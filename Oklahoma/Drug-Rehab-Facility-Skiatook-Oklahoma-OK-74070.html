      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Rather, we offer an educational cognitive behavioral education program that helps you identify the habits that led you to choose drugs and help you create different habits and a more fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle. Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse.

      Inpatient Rehab Centers in Ohio Offer Your Best Chance at Recovery from Addiction To meet the crisis of higher rates of substance abuse, Ohio’s inpatient rehab centers offer the latest rehabilitation science techniques and therapies. 
      During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
