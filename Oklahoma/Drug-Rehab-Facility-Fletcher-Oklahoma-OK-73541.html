      Friends and family: The loved ones of those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol often want to help but aren’t always sure how to bring it up. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.

      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Give us a call and we’ll help you to find the perfect place for you in this wonderful state. 
      Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem.

      The manager, Bradley Cottermole, then came to our table, kneeled down, and said to Arianna, “I heard we gave you a broken cheeseburger! Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.

      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.
