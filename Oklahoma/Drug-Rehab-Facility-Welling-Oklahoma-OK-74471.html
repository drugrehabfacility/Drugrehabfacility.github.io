      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.

      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. RDD Center admits patients to our licensed surgical facility for the detoxification procedure to guarantee the proper monitoring and medical care. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      From patient from abroad, there is a preliminary part in which the patient sends us the information for his case via e-mail. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.

      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself.
