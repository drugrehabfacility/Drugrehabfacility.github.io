      Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. This is not something you can do safely on your own.
