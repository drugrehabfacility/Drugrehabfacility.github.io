      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.
