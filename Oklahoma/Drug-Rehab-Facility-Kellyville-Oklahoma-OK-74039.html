      Most of the times the medication given at detox facilities in Washington are a safety matter because some withdrawal symptoms can be fatal. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.
