      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
