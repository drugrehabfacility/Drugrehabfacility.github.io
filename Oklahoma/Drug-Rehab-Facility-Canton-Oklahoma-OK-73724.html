      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.

      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. 
      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. 
      Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.
