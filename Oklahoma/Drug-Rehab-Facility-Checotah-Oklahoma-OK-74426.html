      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. Find medical detox centers in your area by contacting us toll-free via phone, chat or email.
