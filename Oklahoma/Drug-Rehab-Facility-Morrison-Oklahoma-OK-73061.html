      This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services.
