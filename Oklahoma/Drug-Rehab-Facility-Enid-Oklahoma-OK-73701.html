      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox.
