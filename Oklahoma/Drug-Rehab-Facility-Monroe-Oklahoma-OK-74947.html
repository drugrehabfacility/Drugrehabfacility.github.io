      A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.
