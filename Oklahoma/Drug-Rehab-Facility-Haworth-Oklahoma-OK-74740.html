      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). 
      Many different Christian treatment methods exist ranging from twelve step methods to other faith-centered approaches to treatment. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.
