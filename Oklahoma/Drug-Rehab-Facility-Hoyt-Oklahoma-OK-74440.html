Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.
