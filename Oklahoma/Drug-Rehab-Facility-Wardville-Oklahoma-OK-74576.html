      During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. If Roger Ebert was still alive, he would give Detox of South Florida two thumbs up! 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.
