      In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.
