      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. At this time, breaking from the shackles with all the habit would difficult for the person’s initiatives.

However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.
