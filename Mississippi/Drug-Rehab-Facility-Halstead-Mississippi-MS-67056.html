      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
