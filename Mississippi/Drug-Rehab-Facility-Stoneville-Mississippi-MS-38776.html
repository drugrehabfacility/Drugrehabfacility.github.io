      Prescription Pain Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – This type of withdrawal is very similar to the withdrawal effects of heroin listed above. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.
