      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. 
      Ohio Drug & Alcohol Rehab While no single treatment works for every person, a unique process will be created for you. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.
