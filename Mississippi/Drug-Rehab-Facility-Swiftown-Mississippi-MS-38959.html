      Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization.

      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.
