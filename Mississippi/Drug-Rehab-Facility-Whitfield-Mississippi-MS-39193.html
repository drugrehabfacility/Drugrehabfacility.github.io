      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      They should e ready on the process that they will have especially for the withdrawal stages that they will experience. Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      Each person who has to go through the detox facilities in Washington just wants someone who cares while also somehow managing to beat the discomfort of the physical withdrawal from opiates, benzos, alcohol, cocaine and more. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die.
