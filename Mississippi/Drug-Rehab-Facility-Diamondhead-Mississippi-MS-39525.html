      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox.Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.

Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification.
