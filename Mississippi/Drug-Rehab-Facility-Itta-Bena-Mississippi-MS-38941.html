      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      When you search, you'll get a list of drug rehab facilities that includes information about the rehabilitation center. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña.

      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol.
