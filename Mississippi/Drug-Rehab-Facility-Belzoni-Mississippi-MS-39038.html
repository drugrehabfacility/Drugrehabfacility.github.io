      This allows the staff and the client to truly relate and get some really positive feedback and what steps need to be taken after detox to remain sober. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs.
