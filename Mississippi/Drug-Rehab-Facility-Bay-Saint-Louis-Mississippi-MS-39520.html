      The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.

      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Opiate Detox Centers One of the most dangerous and most addictive classes of drugs available today is the opiate. Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. 
      Uinderstand that methadone is a highly addictive substitute where the withdraw can be up to three times worse than heroin. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time.

      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. 
      I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs.
