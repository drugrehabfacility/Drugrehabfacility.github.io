      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      21% were admitted for alcohol rehab while the remaining for drug rehab. We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care.

      Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges.
