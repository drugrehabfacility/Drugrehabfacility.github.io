      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it.The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. 
      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.
