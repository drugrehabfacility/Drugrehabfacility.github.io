      Rapid Detox Versus Traditional Detox Free Detox Centers Some people just can’t afford any type of treatment for their addiction. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable.

      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.
