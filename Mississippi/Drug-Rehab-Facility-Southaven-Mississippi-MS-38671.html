      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox.

      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well.

      When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. 
      Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.

In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.

Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.
