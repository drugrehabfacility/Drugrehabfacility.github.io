      I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. Whether you’re having nausea or you feel like you need someone to speak with, our professionals will be there for you. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
