      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped.

Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Medical detox is available through high quality drug detox centers under the supervision of medical professionals.

      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.

      Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
