      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal.In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible.If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.
