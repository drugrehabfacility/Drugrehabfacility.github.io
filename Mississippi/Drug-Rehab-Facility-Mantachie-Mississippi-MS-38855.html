      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private.
