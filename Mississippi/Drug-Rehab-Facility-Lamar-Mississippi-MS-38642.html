      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      Our addiction specialists can assess your recovery needs and help you get the addiction treatment that provides the best chance for your long-term recovery.Easy drug detox is a successful method of drug detoxification.

      Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.
