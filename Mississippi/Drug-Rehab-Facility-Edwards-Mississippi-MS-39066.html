      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others.

      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.
