      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab.
