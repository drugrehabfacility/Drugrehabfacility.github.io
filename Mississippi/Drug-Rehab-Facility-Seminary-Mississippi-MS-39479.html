      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction. We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      Our medical teams use the latest evidence-based approaches to make sure this period is safe and as comfortable as possible.
