      Medical Detox Centers Many hospitals and residential treatment facilities provide medical detox centers as part of their overall treatment regimen. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.

      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete.
