      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Really subsequent to the consumption of heroin drug will become an integral part of the life-style, this person ruins the life that they have, the family and career, or even they can commit crimes as well as have disease. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).

There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.
