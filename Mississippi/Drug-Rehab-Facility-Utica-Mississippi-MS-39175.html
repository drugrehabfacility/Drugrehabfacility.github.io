      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
