In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery.

      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers.But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol.
