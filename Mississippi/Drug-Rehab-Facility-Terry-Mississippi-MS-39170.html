      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s).
