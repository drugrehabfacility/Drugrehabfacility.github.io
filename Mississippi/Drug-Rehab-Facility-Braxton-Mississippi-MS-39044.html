      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist.
