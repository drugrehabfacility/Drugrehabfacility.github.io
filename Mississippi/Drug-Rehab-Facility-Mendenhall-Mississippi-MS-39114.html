      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Write to us at info@angelesofvictory.com, or give us a call toll-free at 1-877-663-3869. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor.
