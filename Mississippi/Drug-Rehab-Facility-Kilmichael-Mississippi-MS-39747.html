      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them.
