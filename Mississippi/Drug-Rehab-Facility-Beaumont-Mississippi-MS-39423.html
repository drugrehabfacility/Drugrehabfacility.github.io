      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center. If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live.
