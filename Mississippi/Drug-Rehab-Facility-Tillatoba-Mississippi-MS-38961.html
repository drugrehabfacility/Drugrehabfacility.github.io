      IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body. The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox.
