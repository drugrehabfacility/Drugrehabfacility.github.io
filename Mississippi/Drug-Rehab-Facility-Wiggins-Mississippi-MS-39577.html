      Friends and family: The loved ones of those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol often want to help but aren’t always sure how to bring it up. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult.
