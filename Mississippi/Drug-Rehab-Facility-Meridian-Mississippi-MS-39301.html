      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. For more information on rehabilitation and the detox process, contact us today. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. 
      Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.

      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery.
