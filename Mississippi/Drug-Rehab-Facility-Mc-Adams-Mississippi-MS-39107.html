      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 4) Methadone Clinic in Connecticut: A methadone clinic is not actually a “detox”, although methadone is sometimes used to help someone to stop using opiates. 
      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state.

      800-483-2193 Rapid Detox Centers A relatively new method of assisting those who are addicted to opiates in overcoming the physical dependence that they suffer from is the rapid detox method. The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
