Originally founded as an orphanage for boys in 1916, Rosecrance has grown and evolved significantly, and now helps more than 13,000 people each year. 
      Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
