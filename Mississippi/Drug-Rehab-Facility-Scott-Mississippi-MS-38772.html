      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse.

      Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
