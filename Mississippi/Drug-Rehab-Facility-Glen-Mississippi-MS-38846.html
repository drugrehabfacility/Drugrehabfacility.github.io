      Advocate Addiction Treatment Center, Des Plaines (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today For those who need medical help for a problem with substance abuse, it does not come better than one that is provided by a hospital. Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Excellent detox which rejuvenates life is essential to make significant gains in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs.
