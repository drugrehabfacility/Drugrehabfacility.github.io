      While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. 
      Independent centers may use their own detox facilities when needed. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal.
