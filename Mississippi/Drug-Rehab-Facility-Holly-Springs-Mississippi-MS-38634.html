      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address.
