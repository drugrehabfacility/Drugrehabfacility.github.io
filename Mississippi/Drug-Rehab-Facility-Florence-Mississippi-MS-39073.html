      Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs.
