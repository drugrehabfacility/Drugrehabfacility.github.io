      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit. 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic.
