      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now.

      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance.
