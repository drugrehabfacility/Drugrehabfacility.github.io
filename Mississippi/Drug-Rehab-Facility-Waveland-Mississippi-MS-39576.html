      Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
