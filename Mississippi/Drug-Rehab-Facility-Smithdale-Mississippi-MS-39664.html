      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland.

If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe.
