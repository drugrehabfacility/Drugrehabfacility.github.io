      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict.
