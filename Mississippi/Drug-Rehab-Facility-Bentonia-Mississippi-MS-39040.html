      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc.
