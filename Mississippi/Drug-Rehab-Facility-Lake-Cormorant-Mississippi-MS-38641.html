      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs.

      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
