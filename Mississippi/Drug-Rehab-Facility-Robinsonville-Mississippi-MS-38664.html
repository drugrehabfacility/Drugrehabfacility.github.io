      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. 
      While the lights and the glam of the casinos are certainly a draw, Las Vegas is also home to an interesting and varied history and surrounded by historical and natural sites to behold. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms – This includes symptoms such as seizures, extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, suicide, muscle aches, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, mood swings and many, many more. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse.
