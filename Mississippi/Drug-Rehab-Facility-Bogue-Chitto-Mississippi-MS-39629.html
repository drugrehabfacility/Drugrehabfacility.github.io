      Center for Addiction Treatment, Cincinnati (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Center for Addiction Treatment is just that–a place where individuals can go to begin or work on their recovery.

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor.
