      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has.
