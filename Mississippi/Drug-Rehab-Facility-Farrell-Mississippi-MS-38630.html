      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
