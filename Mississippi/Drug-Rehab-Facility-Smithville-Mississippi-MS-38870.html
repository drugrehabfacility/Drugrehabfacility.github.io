      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
