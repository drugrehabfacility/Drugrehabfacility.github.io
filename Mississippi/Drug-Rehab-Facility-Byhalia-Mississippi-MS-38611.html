      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature. 
      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision.
