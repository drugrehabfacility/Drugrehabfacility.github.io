      For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.

      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. Do you know someone who is looking for a drug and alcohol detox center in Illinois?

      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason.
