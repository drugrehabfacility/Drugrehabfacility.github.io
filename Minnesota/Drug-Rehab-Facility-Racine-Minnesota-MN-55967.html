      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab.

      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. 
      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
