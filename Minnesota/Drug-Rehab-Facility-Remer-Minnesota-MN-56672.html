      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked.
