      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.

      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.

      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.
