      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. 
      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
