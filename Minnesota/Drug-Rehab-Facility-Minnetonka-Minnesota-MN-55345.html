      Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 - OR - Request a Callback Palm Partners Treatment Center is one of the most successful drug rehab centers in the country at a fraction of the price of other addiction treatment centers. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.DETOX FACILITIES Though many choose to detox through a general hospital, United Drug Rehab Group clients go through an emotionally stronger and more stable backdrop for their recovery. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings.

The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process.
