      These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own.

      The 38-acre property provides an attractive setting for recovery and contemplation, including comfortable and comforting rooms, a full gymnasium, and beautiful natural surroundings. Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. 
      The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. 5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. 
      Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
