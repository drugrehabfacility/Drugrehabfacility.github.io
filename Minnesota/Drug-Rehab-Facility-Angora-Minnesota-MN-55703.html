      Changes to watch for include: Serious money problems Relationship conflicts over drug use Loss of motivation to meet work/school responsibilities Problems with the law, such as DUIs Inpatient vs. Find an Amphetamine Addiction Treatment Center After so many weeks or months of amphetamine abuse, there’s a growing need for some form of treatment help.
