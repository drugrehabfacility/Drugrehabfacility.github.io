      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. 
      These individuals may not know that there are options for them. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being.

      If you’re seeking intervention resources, want to learn more about our programs or seek help for a loved one, contact us. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is.
