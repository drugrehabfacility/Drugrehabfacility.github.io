      Addiction Treatment is Pinnacle Medical Detox Staff In order to overcome a drug or alcohol addiction seeking out treatment from a drug detox center or treatment center is essential. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions.
