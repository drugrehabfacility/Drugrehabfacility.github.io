      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. 
      In the United States, it's the most prevalent of the addictions of the nation. People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.

      As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox.
