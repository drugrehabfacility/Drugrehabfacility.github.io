Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it.
