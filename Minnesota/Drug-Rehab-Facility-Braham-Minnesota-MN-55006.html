      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. I've dedicated my life to helping others gain health and happiness. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal.
