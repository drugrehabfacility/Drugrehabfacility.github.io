      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"...
