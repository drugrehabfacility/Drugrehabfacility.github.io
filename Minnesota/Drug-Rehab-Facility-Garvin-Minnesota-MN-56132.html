      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.

      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program.
