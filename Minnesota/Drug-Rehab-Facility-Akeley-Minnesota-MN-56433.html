      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.

      Search options allow certain requirements to be notated based on the individual’s requirements. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction.
