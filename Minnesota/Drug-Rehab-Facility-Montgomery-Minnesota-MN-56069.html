      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

      If you are a resident of Illinois and you need to resort to the treatment programs meted out by these organizations, you will find the Chicago detox centers useful.
