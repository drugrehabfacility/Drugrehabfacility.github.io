      Heroin use in Ohio is also higher than national averages. Natural Treatment for Drug Addiction Natural detox is still a popular form of overcoming one’s physical addiction to drugs. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox.

      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well.It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
