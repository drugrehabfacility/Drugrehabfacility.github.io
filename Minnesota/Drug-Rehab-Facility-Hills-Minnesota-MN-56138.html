      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. 
      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin.
