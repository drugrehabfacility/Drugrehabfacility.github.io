      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Translation to English by Sergio Cadena 14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 3 months Ago Get to know our Emcee for this year's East Bay Center's 2nd Annual Gala Patrick Little of WPRI.com. The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      To them, everyone should already know the dangers of drugs and that, if you use them, you are a character of low morality and willpower whose principles need a lot of work. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.
