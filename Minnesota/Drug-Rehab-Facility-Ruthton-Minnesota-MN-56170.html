      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling.

      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
