      Multi-dimensional family therapy: is specially meant to help addicts recover through the support of their families. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
