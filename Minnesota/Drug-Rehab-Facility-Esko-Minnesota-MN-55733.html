      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. 
      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program.
