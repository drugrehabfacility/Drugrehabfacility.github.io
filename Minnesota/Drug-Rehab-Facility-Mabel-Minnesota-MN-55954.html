      With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      Multi-dimensional family therapy: is specially meant to help addicts recover through the support of their families. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.
