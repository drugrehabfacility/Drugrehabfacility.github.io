      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse.
