      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      The main thing that the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts can provide is to give assurance that the person will recover and have a new life. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
