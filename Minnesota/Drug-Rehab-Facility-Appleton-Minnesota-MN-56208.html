      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated.

      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away.

      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity.

      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace.
