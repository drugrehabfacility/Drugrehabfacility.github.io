      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. RehabCenter.net offers free information about Ohio’s residential rehab programs. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount.
