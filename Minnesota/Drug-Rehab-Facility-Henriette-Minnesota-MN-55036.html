      IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. This makes for a stunning backdrop and a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities.
