      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
