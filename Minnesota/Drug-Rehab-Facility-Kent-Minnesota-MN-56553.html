      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense.
