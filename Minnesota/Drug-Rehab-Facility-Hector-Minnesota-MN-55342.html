      Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. 
      Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist.
