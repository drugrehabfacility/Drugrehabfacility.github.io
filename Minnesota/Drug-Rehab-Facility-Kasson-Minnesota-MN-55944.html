For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. 
      Toll-free 800-483-2193 Call Now If you or someone you love is interested in holistic drug detox, call now to find a program near you. At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.
