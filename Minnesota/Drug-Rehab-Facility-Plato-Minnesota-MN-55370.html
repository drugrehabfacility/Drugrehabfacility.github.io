      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need.
