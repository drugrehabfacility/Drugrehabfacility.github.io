      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. 
      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Above the Standard: I believe in only working with people and centers that I personally trust. In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014.
