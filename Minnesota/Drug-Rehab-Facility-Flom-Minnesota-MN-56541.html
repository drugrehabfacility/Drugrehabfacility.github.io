      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol.People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse.

      You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
