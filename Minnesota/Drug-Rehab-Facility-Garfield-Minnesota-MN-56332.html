      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process.
