      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. 
      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Call 800-483-2193 today for help finding safe, effective detox facilities in New Jersey.

Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink.

      The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol.
