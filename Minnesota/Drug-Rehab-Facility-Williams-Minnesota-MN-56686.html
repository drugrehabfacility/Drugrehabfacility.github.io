      A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      It does not have sympathy for any one race, gender, nation or background. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer.
