You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.

      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.

      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control.

      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself. At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage.
