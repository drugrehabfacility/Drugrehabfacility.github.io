      Get Listed in Our Directory Are you a treatment center who specializes in opioid addiction treatment through the use of Buprenorphine or other methods? Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.
