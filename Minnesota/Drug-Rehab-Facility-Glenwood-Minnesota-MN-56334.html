      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control.

      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal.
