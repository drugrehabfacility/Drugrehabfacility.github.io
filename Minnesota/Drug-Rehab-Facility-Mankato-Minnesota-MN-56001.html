      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort.
