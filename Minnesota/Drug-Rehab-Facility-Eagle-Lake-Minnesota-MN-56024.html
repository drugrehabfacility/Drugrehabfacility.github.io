      The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares.
