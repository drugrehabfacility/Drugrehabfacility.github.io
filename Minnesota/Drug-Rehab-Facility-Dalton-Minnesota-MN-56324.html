      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body.
