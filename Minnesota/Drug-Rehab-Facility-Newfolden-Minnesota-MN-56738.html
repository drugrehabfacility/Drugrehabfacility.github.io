      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.
