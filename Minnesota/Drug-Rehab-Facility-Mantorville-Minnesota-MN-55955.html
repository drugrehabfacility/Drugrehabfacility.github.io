      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction.
