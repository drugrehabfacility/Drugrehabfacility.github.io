      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.

The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses.
