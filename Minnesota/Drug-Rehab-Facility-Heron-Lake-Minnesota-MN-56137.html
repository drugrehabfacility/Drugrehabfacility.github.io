      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox.
