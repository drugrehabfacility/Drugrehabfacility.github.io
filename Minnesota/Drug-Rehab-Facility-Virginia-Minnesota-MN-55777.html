      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. 
      In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.
