      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. 
      Counseling results to intervention which involves seeking professional help by the concerned parties to give the patient the necessary treatment. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.
