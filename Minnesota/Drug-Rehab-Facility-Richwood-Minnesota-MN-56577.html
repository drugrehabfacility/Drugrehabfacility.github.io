      Can I get a private room during my stay in detox? Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. 
      This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs.
