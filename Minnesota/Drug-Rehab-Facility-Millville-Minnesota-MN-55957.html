      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common.
