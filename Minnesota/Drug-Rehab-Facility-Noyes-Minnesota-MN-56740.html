A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal.
