      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body.

      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
