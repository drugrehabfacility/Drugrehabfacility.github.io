      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first.

      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred.
