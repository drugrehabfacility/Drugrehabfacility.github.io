      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.
