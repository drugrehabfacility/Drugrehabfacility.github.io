      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs.

Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings.
