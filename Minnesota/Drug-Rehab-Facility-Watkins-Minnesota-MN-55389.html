      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. We can help you determine what option is best for you. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process.
