    <p>
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. 
      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs.
