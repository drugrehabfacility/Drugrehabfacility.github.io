      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. 
      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs.

      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.

      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis.

      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
