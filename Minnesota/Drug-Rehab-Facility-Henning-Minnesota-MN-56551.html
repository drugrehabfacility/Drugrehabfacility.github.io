      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. 
      Let us help find the right treatment center for you, so you can start living a better life.
