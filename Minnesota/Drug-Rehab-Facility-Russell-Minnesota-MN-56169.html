      Approximately 98% of our patients travel to our center from all over the United States and the world.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.

      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone.Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow.

      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it.
