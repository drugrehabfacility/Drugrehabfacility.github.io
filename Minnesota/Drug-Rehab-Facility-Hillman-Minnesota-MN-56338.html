      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. In some cases, withdrawl can put your life at risk. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. 
      At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency.
