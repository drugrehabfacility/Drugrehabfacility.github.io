      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.
