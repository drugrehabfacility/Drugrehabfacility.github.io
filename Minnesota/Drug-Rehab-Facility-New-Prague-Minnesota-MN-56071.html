      You require help too if you are one of those four. However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      We refer to 30 different recommended centers which can be categorized into 4 basic withdrawal and detox costs. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.

      Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. 
      The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction.
