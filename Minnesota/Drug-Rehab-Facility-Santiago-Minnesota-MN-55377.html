      Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body.
