      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available.

Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. 
      Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      Can I get a private room during my stay in detox? Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me.
