      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs.

      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms.

      There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
