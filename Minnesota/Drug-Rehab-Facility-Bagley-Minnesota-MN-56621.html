      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest.
