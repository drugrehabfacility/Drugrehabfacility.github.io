President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
