      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers.
