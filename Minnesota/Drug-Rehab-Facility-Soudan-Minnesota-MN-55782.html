      A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. 
      Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance.

      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.
