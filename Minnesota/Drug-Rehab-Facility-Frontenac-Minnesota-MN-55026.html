      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. 
      That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. 
      Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.
