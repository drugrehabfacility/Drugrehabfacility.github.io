      Soft Landing Recovery, Oakbrook Terrace (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Soft Landing Recovery has an “at home” outpatient recovery that specializes in helping those with addiction to painkillers and opiates. 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      Some of these drug rehab centers in Ohio are situated on 10-15 acres of land and offer long-term treatment programs, and some offer programs lasting less than a month. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care.

      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence.
