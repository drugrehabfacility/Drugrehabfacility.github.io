      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. 
      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction. Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program.
