      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use.

      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2.

      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling.

As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
