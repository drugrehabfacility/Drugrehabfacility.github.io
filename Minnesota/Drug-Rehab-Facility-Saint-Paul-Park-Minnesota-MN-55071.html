      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      Services between different medical detox centers can be very great. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.
