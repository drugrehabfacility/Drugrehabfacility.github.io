      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day.
