      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      Do they accept private pay or offer payment plans or loans? Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.
