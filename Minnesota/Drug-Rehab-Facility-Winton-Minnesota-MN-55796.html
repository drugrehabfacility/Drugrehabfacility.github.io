      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals.
