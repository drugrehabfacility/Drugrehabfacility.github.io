      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways.
