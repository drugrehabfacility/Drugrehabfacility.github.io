      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      We also help you to establish different behaviors that will lead you to a life that is drug free, permanently. A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. 
      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.

      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons.

      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse. Bar none, Detox of South Florida is the best care I have received.

      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
