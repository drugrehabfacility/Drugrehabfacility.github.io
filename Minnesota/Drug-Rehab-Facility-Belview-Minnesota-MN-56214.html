      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction. 
      What worked for me were the awesome social activities and the involvement of my instructor. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there.
