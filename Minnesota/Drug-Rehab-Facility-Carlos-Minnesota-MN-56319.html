      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
