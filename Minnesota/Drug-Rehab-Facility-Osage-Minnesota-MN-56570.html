      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts.
