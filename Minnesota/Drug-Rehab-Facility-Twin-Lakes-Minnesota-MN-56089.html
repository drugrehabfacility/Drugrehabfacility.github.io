      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
