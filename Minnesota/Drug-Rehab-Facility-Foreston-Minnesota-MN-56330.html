      Many different Christian treatment methods exist ranging from twelve step methods to other faith-centered approaches to treatment. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need.Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases.
