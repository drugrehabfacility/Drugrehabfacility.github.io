      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. 
      Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms – Unknown to some alcohol produces many withdrawal effects including delirium tremens (uncontrolled shaking), seizures, depression, anxiety, stomach aches, vomiting, restlessness and headaches. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. If Roger Ebert was still alive, he would give Detox of South Florida two thumbs up!
