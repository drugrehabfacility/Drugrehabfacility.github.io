      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
