      Inpatient detox centers provide patients with a place to live while their undergo detox. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.

      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      You do not have to leave the city to address your needs or the specialized needs of your near and dear ones.
