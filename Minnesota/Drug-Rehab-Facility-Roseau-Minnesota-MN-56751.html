      For most people, alcohol is filtered out of their system in roughly seven to 10 days. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. 
      Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.

      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program.
