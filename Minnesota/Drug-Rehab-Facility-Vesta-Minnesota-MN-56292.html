      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being.
