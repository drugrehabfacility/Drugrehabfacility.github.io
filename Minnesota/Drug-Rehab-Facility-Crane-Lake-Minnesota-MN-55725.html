      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility.

      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction.
