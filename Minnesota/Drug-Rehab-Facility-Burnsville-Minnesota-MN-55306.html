      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. 
      Our medical teams use the latest evidence-based approaches to make sure this period is safe and as comfortable as possible.

      Alcoholics Anonymous isn't an organization you can see a few occasions and consider yourself "cured." Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is among the very best treatment choices for a recovering alcoholic. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them.
