      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery.

Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility.
