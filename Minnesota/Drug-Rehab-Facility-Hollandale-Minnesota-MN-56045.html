      It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence.
