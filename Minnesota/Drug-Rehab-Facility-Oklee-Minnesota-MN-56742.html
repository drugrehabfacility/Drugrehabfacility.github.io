      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.

Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living.
