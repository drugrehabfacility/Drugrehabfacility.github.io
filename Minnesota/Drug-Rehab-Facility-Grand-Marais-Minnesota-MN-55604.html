      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      These scholarships are often offered through private treatment facilities or through organizations concerned with helping those who are struggling with addiction. The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
