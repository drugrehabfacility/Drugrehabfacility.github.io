      Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center.

Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience.
