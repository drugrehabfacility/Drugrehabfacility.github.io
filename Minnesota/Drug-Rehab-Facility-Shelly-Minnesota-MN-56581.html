      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.

      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.
