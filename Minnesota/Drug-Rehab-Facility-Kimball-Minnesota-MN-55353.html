      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.
