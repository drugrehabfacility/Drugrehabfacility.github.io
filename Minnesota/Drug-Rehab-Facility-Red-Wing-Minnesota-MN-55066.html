      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse.
