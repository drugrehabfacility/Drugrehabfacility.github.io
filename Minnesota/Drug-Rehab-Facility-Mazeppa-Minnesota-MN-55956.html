      Home-Like Comfort – Far from a stark, hospital-like environment, our drug and alcohol detox facilities are home-like and welcoming. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

      Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.

      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time.

The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox.Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology.
