      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      Don’t think that you can’t get back to living a happy & healthy life If you have nowhere or nobody else to turn to, then now is the time to call us for help. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares.

      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.
