      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      Drug Detox Programs Many individuals simply cannot or will not deal with the withdrawal symptoms associated with natural detox. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      You may not know what’s next for you after detox.
