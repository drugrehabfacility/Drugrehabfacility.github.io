      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. This is primarily for safety and security of the patient. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state.
