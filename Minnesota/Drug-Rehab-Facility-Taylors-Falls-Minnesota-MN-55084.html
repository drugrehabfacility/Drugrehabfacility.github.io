      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Most medical centers provide on allopathic approach using symptom treating methods of recovery: drug therapy. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built.
