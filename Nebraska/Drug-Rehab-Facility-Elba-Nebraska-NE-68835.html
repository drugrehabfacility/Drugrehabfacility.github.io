      Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.

      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms.

      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Skilled and continuous assessment of medical needs during the detoxification process, and rock solid procedures for dealing with any sort of medical emergency that may occur. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. 
      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring.
