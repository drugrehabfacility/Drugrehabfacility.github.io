      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step.
