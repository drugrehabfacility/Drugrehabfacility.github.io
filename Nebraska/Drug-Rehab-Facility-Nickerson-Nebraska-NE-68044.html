      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      These symptoms can be either physical or psychological in nature, and vary according to a number of different factors including: How long the individual has been addicted to the drug Whether or not the individual was addicted to more than one drug The amount of drugs that the individual used per day The physiological makeup of the individual Among the most common physical detox withdrawal symptoms are: Achiness (aching joints or extremities) Chills and sweats (the individual feels as if he or she has the flu) Nausea (another flu-like symptoms) Restless leg syndrome Sleeplessness In addition to these physical conditions, there are also a number of psychological withdrawal symptoms associated with detoxification, including: Irritability and mood swings Depression Anxiety Nervousness Why Do These Withdrawal Symptoms Occur? As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.

      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry.

      However, thanks to the large number of alcohol detox centers and drug detox centers in New Jersey to help addicted people. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.
