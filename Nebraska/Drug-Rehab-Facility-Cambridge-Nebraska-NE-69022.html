      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs.
