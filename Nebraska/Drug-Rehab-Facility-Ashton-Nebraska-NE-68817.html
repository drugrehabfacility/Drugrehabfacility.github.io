      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.
