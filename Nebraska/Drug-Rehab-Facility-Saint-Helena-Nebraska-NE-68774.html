      Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.
