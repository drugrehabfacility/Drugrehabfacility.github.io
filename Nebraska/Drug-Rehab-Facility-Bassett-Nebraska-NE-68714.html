      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision.
