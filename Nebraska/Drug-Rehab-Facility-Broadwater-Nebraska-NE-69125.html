      Out-patient delivered to excellent results may be as low as $10,000 for a 10 day program.   Best Detoxs and  Rehabs Integrated Longer Term: Complete withdrawal and full body detox, including educational and complimentary counseling, Full program costs $15,000 to $40,000 for total investment, long term programs 2 to 6 months long, some flat rate fees even for 6 month long term programs. 
      You may not know what’s next for you after detox. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.

      Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.
