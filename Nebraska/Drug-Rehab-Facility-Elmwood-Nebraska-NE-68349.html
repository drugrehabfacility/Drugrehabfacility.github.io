      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment.
