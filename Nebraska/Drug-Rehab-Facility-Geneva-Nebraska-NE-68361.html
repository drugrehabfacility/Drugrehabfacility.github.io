      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results.
