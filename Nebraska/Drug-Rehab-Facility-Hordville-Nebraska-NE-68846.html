      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. How can I choose the best among drug detox centers in Chicago? 
      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. You do not have to leave the city to address your needs or the specialized needs of your near and dear ones. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked. 
      Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery!

      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
