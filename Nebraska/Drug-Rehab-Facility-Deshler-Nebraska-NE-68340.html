      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      All in-patient detox centers offer medically supervised care by either medical professionals closely monitoring a detox or by holistic detox specialists providing 24/7 attention under the guidance of detox doctors. Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped.
