      If you are in need of immediate assistance, please call our toll-free number and we will help you 24 hours a day 7 days a week. There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. 
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. 
      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body.
