If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse.
