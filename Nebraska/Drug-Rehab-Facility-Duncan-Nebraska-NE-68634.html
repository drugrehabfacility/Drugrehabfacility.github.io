      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse.

    <p>
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      For a complete list of items we provide and items you should bring, please contact our Admissions team. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal.
