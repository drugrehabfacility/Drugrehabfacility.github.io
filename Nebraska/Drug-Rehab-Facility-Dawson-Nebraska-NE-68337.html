      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. Prescription Pain Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – This type of withdrawal is very similar to the withdrawal effects of heroin listed above. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers.
