      Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address. 
      The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care.
