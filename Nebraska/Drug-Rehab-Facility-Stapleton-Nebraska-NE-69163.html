      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function.
