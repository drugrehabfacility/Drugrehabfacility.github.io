      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
