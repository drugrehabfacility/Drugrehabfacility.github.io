      Finding Substance Abuse Treatment In Illinois Illinois has such deep and rich history within the United States, spanning from the historic Route 66 running through the state, to the iconic memorials of Abraham Lincoln. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused.

However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.
