      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role.Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately.

      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab.
