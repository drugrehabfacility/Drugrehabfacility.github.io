Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. They should e ready on the process that they will have especially for the withdrawal stages that they will experience. 
      Please tell Kathy she is great, and made a big difference for me. From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.
