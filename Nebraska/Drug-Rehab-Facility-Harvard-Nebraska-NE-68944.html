      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
