      We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey. 
      Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. 
      Our advisors are on call to answer any questions on the costs of detox facilities and addiction treatment programs in Connecticut, CT, including coverage for private healthcare and medical insurance. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.

      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. Outpatient detoxification as safe and effective as inpatient detoxification for those with mild withdrawal benefits those with positive, supportive family circumstances or job situations can continue to work and maintain day-to-day activities with fewer disruptions greater social support opportunities than inpatient increased risk of relapse resulting due to easy access of drugs/alcohol less expensive less time consuming not appropriate for all patients; requires assessment retain greater freedom suitable for those with high motivation to complete detox Inpatient detoxification 24/7 medical support cases of heavy alcohol/drug dependence or chronic use cases of previous complications or intense symptoms of withdrawal higher cost may encourage unnecessary dependence on hospital staff more likely to complete detoxification process than outpatient suitable for suicidal or homicidal patients suitable for those at risk of potentially life-threatening complications of withdrawal suitable for those in adverse or disruptive family or job situations suitable for those not able to travel daily to a treatment facility suitable for those with severe or medically complicated withdrawal Being anxious about entering a detox treatment program is natural. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
