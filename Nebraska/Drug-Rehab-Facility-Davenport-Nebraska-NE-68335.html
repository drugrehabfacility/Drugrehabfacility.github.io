      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment.
