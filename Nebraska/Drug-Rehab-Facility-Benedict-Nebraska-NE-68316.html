      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Some of these symptoms can be medically dangerous and lead to damaging side effects. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. With lovely rural areas and bustling industrious cities, there is much to see and do no matter if you love the city life or the country life. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free.
