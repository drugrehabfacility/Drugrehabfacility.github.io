      While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. Most of the times the medication given at detox facilities in Washington are a safety matter because some withdrawal symptoms can be fatal. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
