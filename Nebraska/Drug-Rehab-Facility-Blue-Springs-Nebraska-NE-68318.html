      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Let us help you find the right #addiction treatment program. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
