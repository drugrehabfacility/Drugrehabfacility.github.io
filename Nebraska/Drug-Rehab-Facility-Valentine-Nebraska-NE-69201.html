      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.

      Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups.Alcohol and drug withdrawal detox programs in Connecticut, CT include: Medical detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, alcohol detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, drug detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, opiate detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, suboxone detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, vicodin detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, ultracet detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, methadone detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, methamphetamine "Crystal meth" detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, and detoxification centers and programs using suboxone and buprenorphine in Connecticut, CT.
