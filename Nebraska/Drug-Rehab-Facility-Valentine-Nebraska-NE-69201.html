      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.

      Integrated and Holistic: I define the best Integrated detox centers as specialists in natural medicine and alternative medical treatments. Therefore the right detox withdrawal advice gives you a new lease on life. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.

      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone.
