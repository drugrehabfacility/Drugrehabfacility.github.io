      Rutherford, New Jersey Alcohol and Drug Detox: Your One-Stop Detox and Rehab Facility Most rehabilitation centers today require an addict to undergo a detoxification process elsewhere before enrollment into their rehab programs. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. To them, everyone should already know the dangers of drugs and that, if you use them, you are a character of low morality and willpower whose principles need a lot of work. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).

      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being. Your will worry you and possibly fill you with shame. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
