      Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 
      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
