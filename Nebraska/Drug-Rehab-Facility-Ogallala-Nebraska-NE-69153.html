      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      Our programs for drug withdrawal in Howell offers the best possible care to all of our patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms.Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox?

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs.
