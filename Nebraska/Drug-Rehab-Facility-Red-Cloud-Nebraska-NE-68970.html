      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
