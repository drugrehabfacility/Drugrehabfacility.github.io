      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated with Drug Detox Each drug affects the brain in a different way. 
      In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving.
