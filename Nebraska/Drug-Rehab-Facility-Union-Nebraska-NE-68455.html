      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.
