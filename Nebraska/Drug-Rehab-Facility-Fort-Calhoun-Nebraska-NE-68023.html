      If you need alcohol for your body to feel normal, then you likely need help. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey.
