      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. We know what it takes to break free of substance use, and we support you 24/7 with on-site nursing staff, top-shelf meals for proper nutrition,  and everything you need to succeed with your detox.Testimonial: I couldn’t stop using – it’s as simple as that; I called Treatment Center Finder and they got me right into drug detox! -Billie J.

      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
