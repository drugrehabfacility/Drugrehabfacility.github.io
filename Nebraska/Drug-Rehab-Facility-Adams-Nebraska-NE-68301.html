      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required.
