      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine. 
      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results.

      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance.
