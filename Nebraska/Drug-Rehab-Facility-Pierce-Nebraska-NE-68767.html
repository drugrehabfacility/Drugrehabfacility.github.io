      Maryland Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Between 2014 and 2015, Maryland’s rate of fatal drug overdose increased 20. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      800-483-2193 Call the 24-HOUR ADDICTION Hotline RELATED PAGES Family is Forever! Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
