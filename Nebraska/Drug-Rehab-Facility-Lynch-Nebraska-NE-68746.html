      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse.

      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      The healthcare professional assures that the prescription of the medicine is within an inferior volume. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms.

      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. 
      24-Hour Care At our addiction treatment center, individuals receive 24-hour medical care that which includes psychiatric and nursing care as well as personalized wellness and medication plans. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
