      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.

      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts.

      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment.

      S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.

      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.

      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox.

      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance.

Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency.
