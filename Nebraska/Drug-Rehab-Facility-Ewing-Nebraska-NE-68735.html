      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less. (AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though.
