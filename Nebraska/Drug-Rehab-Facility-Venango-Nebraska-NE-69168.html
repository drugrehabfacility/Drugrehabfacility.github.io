      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine. When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal.
