      Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. 
      A successful attempt at quitting depends on ability to locate drug detox centers run to scientific principles, ones that recognize detox as one step of an involved in ongoing process. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.

      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.

      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms.
