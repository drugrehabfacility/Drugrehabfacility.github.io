      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.

      After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. Jude Retreats: I did not realize how much of an influence you all have had on my life until I have run into situations where I feel nothing is going right. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches.
