      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.
