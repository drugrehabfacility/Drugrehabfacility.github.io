Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room.

      The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions.Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released.
