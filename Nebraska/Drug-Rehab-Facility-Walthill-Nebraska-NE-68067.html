      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety.
