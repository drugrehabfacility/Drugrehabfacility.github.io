      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage.Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more.

      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be.
