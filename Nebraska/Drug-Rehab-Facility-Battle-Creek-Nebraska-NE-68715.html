      When you are considering a facility for drug detox in Connecticut, consider a service that will not only be safe and effective but will also keep you comfortable. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. 
      Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good.
