    <p>
      We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
