      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative.

      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
