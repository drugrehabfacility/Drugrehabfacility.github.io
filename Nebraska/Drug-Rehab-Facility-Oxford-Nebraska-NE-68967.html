      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. We know what it takes to break free of substance use, and we support you 24/7 with on-site nursing staff, top-shelf meals for proper nutrition,  and everything you need to succeed with your detox.Testimonial: I couldn’t stop using – it’s as simple as that; I called Treatment Center Finder and they got me right into drug detox! -Billie J. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.
