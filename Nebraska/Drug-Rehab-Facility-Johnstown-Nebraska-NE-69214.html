      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. 
      Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them.
