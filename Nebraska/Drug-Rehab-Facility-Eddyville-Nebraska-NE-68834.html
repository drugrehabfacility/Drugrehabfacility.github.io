      Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used.

      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
