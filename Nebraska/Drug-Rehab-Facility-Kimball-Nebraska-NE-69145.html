      Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help.

The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive.
