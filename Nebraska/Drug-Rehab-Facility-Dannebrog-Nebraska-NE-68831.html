      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
