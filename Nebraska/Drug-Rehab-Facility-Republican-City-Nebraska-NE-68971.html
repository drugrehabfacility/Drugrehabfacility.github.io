      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility. 
      The clinical staff can help each addict and alcoholic find what they need personally to recover.
