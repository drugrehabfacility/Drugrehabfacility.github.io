      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature.
