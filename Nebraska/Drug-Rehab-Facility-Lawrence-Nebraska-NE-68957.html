      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. All provided by a counseling service that works 24 hours a day that can give you an early appointment or schedule a medical visit if that is what you require by the time you call them up. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.
