      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well.

      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy.For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons.
