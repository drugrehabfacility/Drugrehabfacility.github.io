      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      In the United States, it's the most prevalent of the addictions of the nation.
