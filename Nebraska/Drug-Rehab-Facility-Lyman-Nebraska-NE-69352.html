      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.

      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable.

      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.
