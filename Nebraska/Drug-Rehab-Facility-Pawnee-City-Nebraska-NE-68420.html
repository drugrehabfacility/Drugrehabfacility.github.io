      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community. Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
