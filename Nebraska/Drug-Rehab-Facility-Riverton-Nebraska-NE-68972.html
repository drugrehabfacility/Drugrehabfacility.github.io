      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      These symptoms can be either physical or psychological in nature, and vary according to a number of different factors including: How long the individual has been addicted to the drug Whether or not the individual was addicted to more than one drug The amount of drugs that the individual used per day The physiological makeup of the individual Among the most common physical detox withdrawal symptoms are: Achiness (aching joints or extremities) Chills and sweats (the individual feels as if he or she has the flu) Nausea (another flu-like symptoms) Restless leg syndrome Sleeplessness In addition to these physical conditions, there are also a number of psychological withdrawal symptoms associated with detoxification, including: Irritability and mood swings Depression Anxiety Nervousness Why Do These Withdrawal Symptoms Occur? Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit.
