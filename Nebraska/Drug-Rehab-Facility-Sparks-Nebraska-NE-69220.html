      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems.
