      Waiting Room Operating Room Recovery Room Recovery Room RDD Center performs our rapid drug detoxification procedure in a state-of-the-art, licensed surgical center providing patients effective results, superior care, safety, privacy and quality. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur.

      In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety.Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Pharmaceutical-based treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Personal events, trauma and the environment does affect drug use.This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.

      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs.
