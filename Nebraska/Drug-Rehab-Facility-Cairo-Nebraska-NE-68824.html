      Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy.
