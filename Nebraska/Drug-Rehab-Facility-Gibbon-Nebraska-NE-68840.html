      Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake.
