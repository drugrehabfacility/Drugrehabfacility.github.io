      A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008. The most common reason that people seek out treatment from a drug detox center in the state of Nevada is for stimulant abuse and addiction, namely meth (methamphetamine).
