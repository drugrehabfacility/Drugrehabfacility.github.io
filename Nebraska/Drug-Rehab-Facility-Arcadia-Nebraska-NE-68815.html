      Living a Life of Recovery There are millions of people in the world who are struggling with substance use disorders. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing.
