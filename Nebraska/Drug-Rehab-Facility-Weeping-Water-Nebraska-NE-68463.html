      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.
