      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program.
