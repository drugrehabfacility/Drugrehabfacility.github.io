      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
