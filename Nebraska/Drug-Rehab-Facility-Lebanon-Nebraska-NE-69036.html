      Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. 
      Let us help find the right treatment center for you, so you can start living a better life.
