      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley.

      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms.

      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
