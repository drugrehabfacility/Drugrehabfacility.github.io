      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.

      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. These centers can considerably exceed traditional recovery center effectiveness.
