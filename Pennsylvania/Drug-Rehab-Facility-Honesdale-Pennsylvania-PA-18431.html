      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. 
      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them.
