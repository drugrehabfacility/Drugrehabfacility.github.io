      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Above the Standard: I believe in only working with people and centers that I personally trust. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures.
