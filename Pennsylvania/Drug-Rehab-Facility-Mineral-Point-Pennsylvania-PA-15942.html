      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.

      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.
