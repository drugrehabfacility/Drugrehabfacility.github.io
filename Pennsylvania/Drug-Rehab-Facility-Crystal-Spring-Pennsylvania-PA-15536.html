      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.

      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you.Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something.

      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been.

      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems.
