      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case.In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins.

      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery.

Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox.

      Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      Nevada is an anomaly when it comes to drug detox center admissions, though.
