      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. 
      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).

      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. 
      These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility.
