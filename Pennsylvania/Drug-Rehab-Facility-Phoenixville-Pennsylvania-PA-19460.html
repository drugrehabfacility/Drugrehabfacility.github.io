      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery.

      Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
