      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. Getting the right detox withdrawal advice should save you needless worry. 
      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Use our Online Verification Form to check your plan’s coverage. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Ohio is one of the five national states with the highest rate of overdose deaths. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.

      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life. 
      Find a drug or #alcohol detox program that's right for you or a loved one. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance.
