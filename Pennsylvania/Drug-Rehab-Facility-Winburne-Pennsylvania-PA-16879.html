      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.
