      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs.
