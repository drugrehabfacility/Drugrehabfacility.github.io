      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure.
