      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly. The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.
