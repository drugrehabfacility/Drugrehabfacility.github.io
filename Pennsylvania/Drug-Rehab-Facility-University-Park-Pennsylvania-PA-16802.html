      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. This is not something you can do safely on your own.
