      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. This allows the staff and the client to truly relate and get some really positive feedback and what steps need to be taken after detox to remain sober. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.
