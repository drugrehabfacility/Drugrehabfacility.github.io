      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment.

      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
