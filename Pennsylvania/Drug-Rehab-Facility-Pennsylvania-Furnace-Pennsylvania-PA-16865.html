This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills.

      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.

      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves.
