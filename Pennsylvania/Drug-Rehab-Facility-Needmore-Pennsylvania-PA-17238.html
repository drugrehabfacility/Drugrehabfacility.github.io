      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.
