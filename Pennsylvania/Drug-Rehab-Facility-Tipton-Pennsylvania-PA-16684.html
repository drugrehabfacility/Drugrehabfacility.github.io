      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Inpatient detox centers provide patients with a place to live while their undergo detox. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined.
