      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.
