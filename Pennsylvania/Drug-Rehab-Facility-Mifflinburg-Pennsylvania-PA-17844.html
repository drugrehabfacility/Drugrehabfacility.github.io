      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing. 
      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery.

      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. By putting the same effort in to your recovery that you did into your addiction you can reach addiction recovery.
