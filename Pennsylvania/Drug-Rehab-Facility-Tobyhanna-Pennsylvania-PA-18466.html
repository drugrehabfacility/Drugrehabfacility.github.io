    <p>
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      Whether you are looking for a drug detox in Boston or any other area, we can help. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?

      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help.
