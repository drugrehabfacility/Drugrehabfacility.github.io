      There are many people going through what you are right now. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.
