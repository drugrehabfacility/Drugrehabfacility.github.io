      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person.

      Types of Detox Facilities Various methods exist to help someone detoxify from drugs. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.
