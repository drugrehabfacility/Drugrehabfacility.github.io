      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step.
