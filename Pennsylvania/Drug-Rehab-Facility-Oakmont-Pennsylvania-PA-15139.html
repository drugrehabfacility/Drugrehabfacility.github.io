      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. 
      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. 
      We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles!

Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.
