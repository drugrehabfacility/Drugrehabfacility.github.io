The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.

      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol.
