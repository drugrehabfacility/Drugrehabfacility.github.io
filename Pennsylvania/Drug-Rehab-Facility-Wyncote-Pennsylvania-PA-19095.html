    </p>
    <p>
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.

      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. 
      Find a drug or #alcohol detox program that's right for you or a loved one.
