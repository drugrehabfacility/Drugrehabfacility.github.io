      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now.
