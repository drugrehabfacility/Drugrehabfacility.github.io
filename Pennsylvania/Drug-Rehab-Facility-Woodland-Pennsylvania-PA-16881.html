Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature.This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Home-Like Comfort – Far from a stark, hospital-like environment, our drug and alcohol detox facilities are home-like and welcoming. 
      During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support.

      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive.
