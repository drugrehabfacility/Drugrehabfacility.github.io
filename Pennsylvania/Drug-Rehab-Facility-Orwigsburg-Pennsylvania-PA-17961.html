      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program.
