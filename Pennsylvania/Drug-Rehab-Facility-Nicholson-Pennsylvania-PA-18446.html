      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process.
