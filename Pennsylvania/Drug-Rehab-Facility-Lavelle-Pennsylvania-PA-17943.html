      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol.

      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Ohio rehab centers are gold standard centers for addiction treatments. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse.

      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
