      I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. 
      We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
