      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Cells in the kidneys move waste out of the body altogether.
