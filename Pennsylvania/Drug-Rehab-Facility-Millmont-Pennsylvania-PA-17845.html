      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group.
