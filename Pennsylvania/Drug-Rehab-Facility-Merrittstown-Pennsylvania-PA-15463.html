      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. You will Detox with Dignity at the Toms River treatment center. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
