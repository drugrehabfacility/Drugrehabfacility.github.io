      There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day.
