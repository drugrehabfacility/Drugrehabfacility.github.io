      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden.
