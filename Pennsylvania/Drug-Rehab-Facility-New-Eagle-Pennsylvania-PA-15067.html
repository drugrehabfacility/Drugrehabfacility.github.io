      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      These pharmaceutical drugs are designed to blunt the effects of the physical withdrawal symptoms that can make regular detox so difficult. Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process.

      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons.
