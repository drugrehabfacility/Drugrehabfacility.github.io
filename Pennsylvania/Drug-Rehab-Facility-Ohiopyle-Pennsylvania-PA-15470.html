      Cells in the kidneys move waste out of the body altogether. 
      You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. 
      When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups.
