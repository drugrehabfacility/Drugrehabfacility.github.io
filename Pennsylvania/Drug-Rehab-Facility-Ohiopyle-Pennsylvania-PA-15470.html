      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. 
      For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? 
      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery.

      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.
