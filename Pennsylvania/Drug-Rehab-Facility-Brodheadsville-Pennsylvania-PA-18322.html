      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Contact us today to find the right program for you or a loved one. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. This allows the staff and the client to truly relate and get some really positive feedback and what steps need to be taken after detox to remain sober.
