      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
