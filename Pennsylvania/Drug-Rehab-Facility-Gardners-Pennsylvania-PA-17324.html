      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.
