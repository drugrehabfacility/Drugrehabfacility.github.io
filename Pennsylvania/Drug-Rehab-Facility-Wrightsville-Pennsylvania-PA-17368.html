Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation). 1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less.
