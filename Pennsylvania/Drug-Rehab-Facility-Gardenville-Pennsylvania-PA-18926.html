      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center.
