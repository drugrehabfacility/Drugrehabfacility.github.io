      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. Vincent Depaul provide free treatment for those who qualify for help. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering.
