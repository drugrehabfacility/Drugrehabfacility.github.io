      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare.The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
