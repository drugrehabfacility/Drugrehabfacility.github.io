      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. 
      To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs.
