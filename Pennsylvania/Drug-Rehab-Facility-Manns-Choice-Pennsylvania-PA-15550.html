      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.
