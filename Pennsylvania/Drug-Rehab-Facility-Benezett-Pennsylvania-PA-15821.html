      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. 
      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery.
