      Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs? 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance.

      You fixded my cheeseburger!” When Lauren walked away, Arianna just sat there for a second and looked at her new burger. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others.
