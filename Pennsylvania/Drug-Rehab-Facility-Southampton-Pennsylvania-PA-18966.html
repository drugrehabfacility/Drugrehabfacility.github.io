      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step.
