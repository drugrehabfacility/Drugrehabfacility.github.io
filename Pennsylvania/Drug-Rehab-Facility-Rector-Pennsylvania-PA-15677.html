Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
