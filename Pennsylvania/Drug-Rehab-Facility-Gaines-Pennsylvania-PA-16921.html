      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are.
