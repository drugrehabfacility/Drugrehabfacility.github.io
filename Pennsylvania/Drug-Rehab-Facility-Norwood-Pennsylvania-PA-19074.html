      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. The standard drug clean or heroin detox in Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts provide full time services from the moment that the person enter into the said program. 
      After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Some of these drug rehab centers in Ohio are situated on 10-15 acres of land and offer long-term treatment programs, and some offer programs lasting less than a month. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path.
