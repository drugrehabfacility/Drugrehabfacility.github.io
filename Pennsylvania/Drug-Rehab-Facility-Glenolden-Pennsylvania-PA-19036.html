      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps.
