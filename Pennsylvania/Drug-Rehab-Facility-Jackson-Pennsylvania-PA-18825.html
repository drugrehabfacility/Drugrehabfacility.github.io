      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.
