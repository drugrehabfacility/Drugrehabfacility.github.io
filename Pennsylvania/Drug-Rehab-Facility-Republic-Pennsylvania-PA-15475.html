      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Ohio rehab centers are gold standard centers for addiction treatments. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.

This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history.Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful.
    </p>

      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.
