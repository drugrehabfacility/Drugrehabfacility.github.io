      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol.

      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. By putting the same effort in to your recovery that you did into your addiction you can reach addiction recovery.

      As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call.
