      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. State-Funded Rehab Most states provide funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation services through public mental health or substance abuse treatment centers that can be accessed by those with no insurance or no income.

      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety.

      Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.
