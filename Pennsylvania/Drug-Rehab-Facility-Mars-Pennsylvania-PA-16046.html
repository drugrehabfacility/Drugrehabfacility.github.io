      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center.

      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms.
