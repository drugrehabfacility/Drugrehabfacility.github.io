      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      You may have: Anxiety Delirium tremens (DTs), a life-threatening issue where you feel confused and on edge Depression Hallucinations, where you see or hear things that aren’t there Problems sleeping Shakiness, especially in your hands Unstable changes in blood pressure and heart rate Do I Need a Detox Program? Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. Give one of our counselors a call now.  1-800-819-9973 Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Locator Service is a public benefit service for those seeking to enter into a treatment program for addiction. 
      Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment.

    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Many people find themselves from hooked on this kind of substances. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
