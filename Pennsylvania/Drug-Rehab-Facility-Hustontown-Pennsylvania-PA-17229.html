      Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience. 
      Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. If you need a snack, you can visit the cafe-style dining area.
