      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance.
