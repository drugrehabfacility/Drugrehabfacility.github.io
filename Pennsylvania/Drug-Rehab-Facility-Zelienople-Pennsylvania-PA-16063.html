    </p>
    <p>
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.
