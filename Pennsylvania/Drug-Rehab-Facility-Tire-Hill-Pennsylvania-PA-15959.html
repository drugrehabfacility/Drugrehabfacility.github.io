      State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.
