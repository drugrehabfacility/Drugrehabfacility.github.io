      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. 
      If you need a snack, you can visit the cafe-style dining area. A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification.
