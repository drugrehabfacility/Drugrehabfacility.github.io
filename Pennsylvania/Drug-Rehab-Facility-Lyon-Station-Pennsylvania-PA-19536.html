      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.

      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications? For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back. 
      The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range.
