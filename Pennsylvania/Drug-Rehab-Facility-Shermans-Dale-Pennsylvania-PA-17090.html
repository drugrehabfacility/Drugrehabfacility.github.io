      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      There are over three hundred drug treatment centers in Maryland.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Maryland.
