      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety.
