      They are also are way to increase comfort by helping with sleep, anxiety, and blood pressure. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.

      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment.

Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures.If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
