      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
