      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. 
      Addiction isn't brought on by the drug, but is brought on by biological and mental vulnerabilities resulting in a variety of kinds of craving." Step one would be to realize the addiction.
