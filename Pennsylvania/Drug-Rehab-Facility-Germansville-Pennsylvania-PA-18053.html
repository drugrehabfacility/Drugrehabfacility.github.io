      The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks.

      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures.

      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.
