      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs.
