      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification.

      Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs.
