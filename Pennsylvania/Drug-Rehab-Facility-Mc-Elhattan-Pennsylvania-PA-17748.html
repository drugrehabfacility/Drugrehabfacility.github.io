      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. 
      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal.

      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite.
