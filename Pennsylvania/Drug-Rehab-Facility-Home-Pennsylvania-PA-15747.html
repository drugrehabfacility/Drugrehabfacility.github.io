      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. 
      Call us today to speak with someone who has gone through what you are going through.
