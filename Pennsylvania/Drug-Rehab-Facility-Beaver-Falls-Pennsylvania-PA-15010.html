      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. 
      With rolling green hills to hike and have picnics on and beautiful lakes and rivers for fishing or kayaking, there’s no shortage of awesome outdoor activities to enjoy.  You can have fun living every day for a long, healthy and happy life. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse.

      At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. 
      State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help.
