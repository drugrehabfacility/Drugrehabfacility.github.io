      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more.

      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. 
      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      Those detoxing can also become dependent on these drugs and start abusing them. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.

      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
