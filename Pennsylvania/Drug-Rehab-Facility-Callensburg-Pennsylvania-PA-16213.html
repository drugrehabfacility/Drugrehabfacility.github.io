      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. Fill in the contact form below or give us a call. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.
