      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.

      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Call now for more information on drug abuse or addiction. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures.5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
