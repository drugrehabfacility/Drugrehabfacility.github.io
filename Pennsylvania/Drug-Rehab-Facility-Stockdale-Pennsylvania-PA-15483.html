      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance. For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. 
      These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs.

When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.
