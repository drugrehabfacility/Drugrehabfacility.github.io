      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.

      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded.

      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Each one of these facilities has their own treatment style and philosophy. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.
