      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
