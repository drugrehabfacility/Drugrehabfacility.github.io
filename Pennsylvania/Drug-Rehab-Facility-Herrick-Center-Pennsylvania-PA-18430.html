      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
