      You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Drug Treatment Programs Drug treatment programs or drug rehab refers to the process of psycho-therapeutic and medical treatment to a person who is dependent on psychoactive substances like hard drugs, prescription drugs or alcohol. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.

      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      A growing number of drug treatment centers in Maryland have services for the hearing impaired. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend.

      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
