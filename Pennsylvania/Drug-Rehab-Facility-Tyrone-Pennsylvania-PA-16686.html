      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.

      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. 
      During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process.
