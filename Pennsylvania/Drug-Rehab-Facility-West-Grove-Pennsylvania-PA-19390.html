      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. XML that has been specially designed to handle such requests. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts.
