      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises.This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.
