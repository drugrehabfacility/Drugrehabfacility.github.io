      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life.

      If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare.
