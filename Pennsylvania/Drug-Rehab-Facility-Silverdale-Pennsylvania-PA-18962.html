      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. 
      Drugs distributed into Chicago are intended not only for the resident market but also for states across the country. Ohio is one of the five national states with the highest rate of overdose deaths. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.
