      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Paying for Treatment Ultimately, paying for amphetamine rehab in Ohio is a matter of accessing available health insurance options or using your existing health plan. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate.
