      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.

Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.
