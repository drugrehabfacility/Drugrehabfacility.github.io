      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. 
      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program.
