      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week! If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves.
