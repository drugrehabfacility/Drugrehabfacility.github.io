Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
