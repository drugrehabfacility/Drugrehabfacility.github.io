      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
