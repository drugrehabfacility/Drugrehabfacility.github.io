      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process.

      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances.
