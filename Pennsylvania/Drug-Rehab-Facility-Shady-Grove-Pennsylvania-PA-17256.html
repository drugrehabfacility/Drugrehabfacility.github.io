      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox?
