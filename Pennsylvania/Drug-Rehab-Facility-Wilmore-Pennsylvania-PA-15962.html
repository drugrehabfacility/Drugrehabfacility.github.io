      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens.
