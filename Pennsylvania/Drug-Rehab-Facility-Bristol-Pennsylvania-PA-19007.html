      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs.

Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Stays may be as short as 7 days costing $15,000 and up.
