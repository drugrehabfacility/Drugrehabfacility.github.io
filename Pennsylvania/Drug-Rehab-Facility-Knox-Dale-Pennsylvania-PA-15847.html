      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Holistic program options are also available in Ohio. 
      Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim.
