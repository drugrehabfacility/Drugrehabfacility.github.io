      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own.

      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? 
      Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center.
