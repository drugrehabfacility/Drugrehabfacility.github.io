      1300857 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 11 months Ago Dear Mr. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
