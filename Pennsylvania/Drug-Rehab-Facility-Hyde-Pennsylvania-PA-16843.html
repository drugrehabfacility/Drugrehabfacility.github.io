      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too. Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. 
      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox.
