      What are the kinds of treatments found in Chicago drug detox centers? And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? 
      No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
