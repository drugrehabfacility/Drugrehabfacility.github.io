      Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.

      The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience. There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. 
      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse.
