      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs.
