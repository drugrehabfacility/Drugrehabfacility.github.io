      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture!
