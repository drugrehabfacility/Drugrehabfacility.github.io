      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. C4 Community Counseling Centers, Chicago (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today C4 is a network of community counseling centers that provides aid and therapy for members of the community. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
