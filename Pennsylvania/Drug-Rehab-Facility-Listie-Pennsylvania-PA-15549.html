      I need another one thats fixed.” Then it dawned on me why she wasn’t eating it. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.

      Medical detox is available through high quality drug detox centers under the supervision of medical professionals. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems.

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor.
