      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.
