      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction.
