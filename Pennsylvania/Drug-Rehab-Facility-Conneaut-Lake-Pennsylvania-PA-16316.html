Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      This can be seen in the cultural festivals, architecture, and history museums around the city. Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.

      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. After the individual continuously use heroin a tremendous negative effects may come up. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
