      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
