      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. They are scattered through the length and breadth of Illinois. 
      The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.
