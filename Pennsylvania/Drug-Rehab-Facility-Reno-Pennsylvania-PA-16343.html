      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      In effect, someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has come to rely on the drug’s effects to cope with everyday life. A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. 
      For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      Paying for Treatment Ultimately, paying for amphetamine rehab in Ohio is a matter of accessing available health insurance options or using your existing health plan.
