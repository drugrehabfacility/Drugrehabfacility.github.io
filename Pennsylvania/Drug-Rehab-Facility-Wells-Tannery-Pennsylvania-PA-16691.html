      Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.

As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      After the initial detox, patients will receive support, education, and guidance on addiction, recovery, and sobriety.
