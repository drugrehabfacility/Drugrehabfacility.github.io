      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Like vomiting, irritation, nausea, nostril, chill. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.
