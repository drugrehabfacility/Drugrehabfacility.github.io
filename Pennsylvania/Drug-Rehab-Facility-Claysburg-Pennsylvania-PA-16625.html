      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
