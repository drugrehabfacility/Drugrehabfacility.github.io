      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances.
