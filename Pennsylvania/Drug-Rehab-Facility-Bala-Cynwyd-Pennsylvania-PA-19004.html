      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being.

      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal.
