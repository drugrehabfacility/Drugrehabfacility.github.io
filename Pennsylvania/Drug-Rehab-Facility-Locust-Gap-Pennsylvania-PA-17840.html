      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs.

      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
