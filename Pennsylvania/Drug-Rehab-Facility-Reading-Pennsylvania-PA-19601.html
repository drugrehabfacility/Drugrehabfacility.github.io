      Medical monitoring and physical care are provided as well as meals, social support and other services to ensure the safety and sobriety of the individual. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members.
