      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.
