      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      For the person interested in history and heritage, Cincinnati’s culture was largely influenced by the large numbers of German and Irish immigrants who settled the area.
