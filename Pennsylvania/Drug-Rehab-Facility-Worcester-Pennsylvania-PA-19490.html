      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers.
