      Drug Detox 
      Treatment </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers in Connecticut, CT, addiction recovery centers in Connecticut, CT, substance abuse treatment centers. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in.
