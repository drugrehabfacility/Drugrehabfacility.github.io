      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission.
