      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs. 
      If you are in need of immediate assistance, please call our toll-free number and we will help you 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting.
