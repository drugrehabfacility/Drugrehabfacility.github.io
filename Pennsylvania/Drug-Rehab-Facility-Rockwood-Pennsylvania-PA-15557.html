      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal.
