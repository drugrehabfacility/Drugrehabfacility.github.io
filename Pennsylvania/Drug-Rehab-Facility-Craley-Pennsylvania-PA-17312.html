      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems.
