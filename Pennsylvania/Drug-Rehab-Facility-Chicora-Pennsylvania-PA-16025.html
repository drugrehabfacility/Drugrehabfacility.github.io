Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored.
