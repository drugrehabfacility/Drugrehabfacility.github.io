      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe.
