      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. Additional time may be needed for alcohol detox if: You have a severe addiction You have a long-term addiction You have numerous previous periods of withdrawal You have a secondary physical or mental condition You are also abusing drugs To learn more about detox lengths in Michigan detox centers, call 800-483-2193 and speak with an addiction specialist. 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming.
