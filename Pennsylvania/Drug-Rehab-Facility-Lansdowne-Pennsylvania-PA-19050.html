      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. 
      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. You may not feel ready to give up drugs and alcohol. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
