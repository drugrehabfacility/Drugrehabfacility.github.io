      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role.

      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol.

      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 800-483-2193 800-483-2193 Get help for your loved one FEATURED CENTERS Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 Family is Forever.
