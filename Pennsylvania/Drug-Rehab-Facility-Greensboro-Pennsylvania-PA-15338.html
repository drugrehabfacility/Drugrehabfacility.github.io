      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.

      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
