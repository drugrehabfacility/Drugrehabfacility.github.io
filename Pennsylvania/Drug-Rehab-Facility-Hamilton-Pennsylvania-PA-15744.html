      Successful Detox: This means you'll get the most care from integrative holistic and medical detox providers who specialize in natural care methods. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs.
