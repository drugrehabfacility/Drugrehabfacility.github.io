      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.
