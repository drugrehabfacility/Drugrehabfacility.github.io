      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again.

      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
