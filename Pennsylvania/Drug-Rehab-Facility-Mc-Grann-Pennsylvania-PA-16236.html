      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? 
      Call today and speak to a treatment counselor about rehabilitation. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
