      IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs.

      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs.Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions.
