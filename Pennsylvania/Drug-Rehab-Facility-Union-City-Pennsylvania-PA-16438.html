      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.
