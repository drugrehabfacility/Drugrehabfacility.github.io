      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      One of the biggest issues in the Las Vegas area as well in Nevada as a whole is drug abuse and drug addiction. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Gin isn’t any faster or slower for the body to process than whiskey. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
