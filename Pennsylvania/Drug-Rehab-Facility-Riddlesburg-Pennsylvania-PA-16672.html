      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.

      We provide a means to achieve physical, mental and emotional healing.
