      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
