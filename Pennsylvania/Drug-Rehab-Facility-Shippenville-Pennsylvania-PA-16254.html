      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage.

      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist.
