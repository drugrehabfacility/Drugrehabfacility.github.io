      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Vitamin Depletion and Drug Use Pharmaceuticals, drugs and alcohol burn up, expedite the excretion of, and prevent the absorption of, nutrients and vitamins. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing. 
      The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you.

      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE).
