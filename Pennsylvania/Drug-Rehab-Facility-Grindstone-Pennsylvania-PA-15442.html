      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.
