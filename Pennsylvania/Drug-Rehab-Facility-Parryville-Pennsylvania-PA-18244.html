      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process.

      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever.
