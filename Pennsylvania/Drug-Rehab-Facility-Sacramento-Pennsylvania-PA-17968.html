      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs.
