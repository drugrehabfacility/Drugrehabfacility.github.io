      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification.

      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context.
