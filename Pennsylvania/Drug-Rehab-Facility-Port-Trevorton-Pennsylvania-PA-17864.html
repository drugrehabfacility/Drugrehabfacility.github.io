      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal. This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Detox in NJ, especially for alcohol abusers, can take fluctuating amounts of time.
