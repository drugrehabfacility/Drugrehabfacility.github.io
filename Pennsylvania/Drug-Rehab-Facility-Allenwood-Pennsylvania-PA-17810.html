      1300857 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 11 months Ago Dear Mr. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Call now to find a program that meets your recovery needs. 
      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Drug Detox Drug detoxification or drug detox is used to reduce primarily the withdrawal symptoms in an individual addicted to drugs. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard.
