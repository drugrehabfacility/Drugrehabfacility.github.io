      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable.
