      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      Together, the pair of you can work through a list of Massachusetts detox centers and select the program that matches your goals, needs, and finances. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      If you have any problem while you are here, the techs and Kevin help resolve the issue in a professional manner.
