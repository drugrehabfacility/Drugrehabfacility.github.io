      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. If you have any questions or comments about our detox facility, please contact United Drug Rehab Group directly.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
