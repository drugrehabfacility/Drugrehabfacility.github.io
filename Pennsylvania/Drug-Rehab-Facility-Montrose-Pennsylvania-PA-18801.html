      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
