      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. I help people find smooth detox and rehab center programs so you can succeed in getting off drugs.
