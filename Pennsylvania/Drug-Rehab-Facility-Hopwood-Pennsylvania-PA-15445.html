      A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.
