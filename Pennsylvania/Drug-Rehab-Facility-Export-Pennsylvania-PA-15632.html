If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit.

      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you.
