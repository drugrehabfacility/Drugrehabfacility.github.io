      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      Red Rock Canyon is a great place to go hiking and climbing or you can head out to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam for tours and boating. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s).

      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment. Illinois & Drug Abuse Alcoholism is a sneaky illness. 
      These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab.
