      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.

      In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use.
