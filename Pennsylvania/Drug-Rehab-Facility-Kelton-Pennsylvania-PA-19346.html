      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs.

      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.
