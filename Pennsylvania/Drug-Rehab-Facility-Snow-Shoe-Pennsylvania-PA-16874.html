      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.

Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try.
