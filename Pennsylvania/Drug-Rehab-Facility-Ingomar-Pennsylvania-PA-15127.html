      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.
