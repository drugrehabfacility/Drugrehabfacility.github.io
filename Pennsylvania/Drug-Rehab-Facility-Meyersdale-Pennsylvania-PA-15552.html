      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.
