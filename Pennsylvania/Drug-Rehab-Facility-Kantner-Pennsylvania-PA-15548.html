      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful?There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.
