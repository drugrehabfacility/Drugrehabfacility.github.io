      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process.

Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center.
