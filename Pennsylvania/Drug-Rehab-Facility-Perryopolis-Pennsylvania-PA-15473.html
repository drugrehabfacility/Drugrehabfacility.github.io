      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. The supervisor (behavioral health tech) Kevin is caring and works hard to make sure all patients are safe and well taken care of.
