      Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. 
      Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community.
