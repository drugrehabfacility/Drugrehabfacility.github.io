Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.
