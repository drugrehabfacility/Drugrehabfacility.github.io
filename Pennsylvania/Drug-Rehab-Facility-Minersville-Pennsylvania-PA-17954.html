      Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs.
