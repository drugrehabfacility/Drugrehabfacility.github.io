      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, treatment needs to consider include: Impact amphetamine abuse has on your day-to-day life Any health problems resulting from drug use Any mental or emotional problems resulting from drug use How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment?

      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
