Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings.
