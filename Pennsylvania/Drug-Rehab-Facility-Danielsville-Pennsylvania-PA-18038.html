      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.
