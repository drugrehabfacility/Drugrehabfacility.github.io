      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
