      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. 
      Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. If you or someone you love is addicted to drugs or alcohol, call our helpline at 800-483-2193 for help finding Connecticut detox centers that will assist you.

      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using.
