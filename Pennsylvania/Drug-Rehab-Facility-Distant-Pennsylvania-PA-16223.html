      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication.

      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses.
