      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs.

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being.

      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
