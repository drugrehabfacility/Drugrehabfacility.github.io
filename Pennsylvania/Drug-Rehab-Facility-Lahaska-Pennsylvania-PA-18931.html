      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.

While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose.
