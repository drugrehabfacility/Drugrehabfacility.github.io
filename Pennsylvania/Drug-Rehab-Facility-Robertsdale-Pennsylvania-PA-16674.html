      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms.
