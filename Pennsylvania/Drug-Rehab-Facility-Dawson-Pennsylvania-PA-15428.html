      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies.
