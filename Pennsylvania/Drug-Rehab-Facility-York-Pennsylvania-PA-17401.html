      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage.
