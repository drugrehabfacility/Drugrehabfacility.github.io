      1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less. (AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction.
