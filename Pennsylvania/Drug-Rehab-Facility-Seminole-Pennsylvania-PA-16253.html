      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      Call our helpline at 800-483-2193 toll-free to speak with a specialist about your recovery needs. Treatment Center Finder is here and ready to help you or your loved one. 
      You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.
