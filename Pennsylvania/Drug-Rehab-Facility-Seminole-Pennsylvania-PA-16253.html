      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. 
      Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.
