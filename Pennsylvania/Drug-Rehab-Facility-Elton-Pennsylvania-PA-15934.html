      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.

      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided.
