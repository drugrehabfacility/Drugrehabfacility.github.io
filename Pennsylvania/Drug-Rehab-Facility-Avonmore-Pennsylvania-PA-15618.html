      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. By putting the same effort in to your recovery that you did into your addiction you can reach addiction recovery. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Rapid Drug Detox Center benchmarks the quality of care to ensure it is higher than the national standard and the best in the nation. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse.

      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting.

In the third phase of treatment is implamantation of the implant. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
