      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. 
      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering.
