      A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008. Services between different medical detox centers can be very great. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
