      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. There are many Illinois Detox Centers Services able to help people suffering from substance abuse.
