      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time.
