      If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.
