      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms.
