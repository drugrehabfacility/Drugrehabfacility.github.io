      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services.
