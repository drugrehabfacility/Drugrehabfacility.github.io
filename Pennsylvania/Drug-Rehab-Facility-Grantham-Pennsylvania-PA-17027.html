      After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition.
