The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      Expect wonderful add ons such as full suites, private rooms with private bathroom; standard rooms include use of internet, cell phones, prime locations, outstanding food and great supports. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life.
