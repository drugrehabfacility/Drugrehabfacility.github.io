It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad.
