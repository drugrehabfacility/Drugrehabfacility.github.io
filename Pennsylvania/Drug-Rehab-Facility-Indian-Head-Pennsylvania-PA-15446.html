      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
