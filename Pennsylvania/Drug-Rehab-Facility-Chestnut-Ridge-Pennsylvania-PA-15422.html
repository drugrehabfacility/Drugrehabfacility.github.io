      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. However, thanks to the large number of alcohol detox centers and drug detox centers in New Jersey to help addicted people. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death.
