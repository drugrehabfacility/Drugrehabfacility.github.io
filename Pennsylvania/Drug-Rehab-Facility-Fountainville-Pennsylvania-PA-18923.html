      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery.
