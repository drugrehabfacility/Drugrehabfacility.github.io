      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. High Drug Use In Connecticut According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Connecticut has one of the highest percentages for drug use in the United States. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment.
