      People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland.
