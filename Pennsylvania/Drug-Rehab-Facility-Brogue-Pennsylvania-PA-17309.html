Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms – Unknown to some alcohol produces many withdrawal effects including delirium tremens (uncontrolled shaking), seizures, depression, anxiety, stomach aches, vomiting, restlessness and headaches. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).

      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. Detoxifying from opioid dependency: Withdrawal from heroin and opioid painkillers can come with very powerful symptoms that begin within six hours of quitting. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.

      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs.
