      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.
