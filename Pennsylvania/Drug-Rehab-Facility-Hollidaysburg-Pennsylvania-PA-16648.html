      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Don’t fall victim to this statistic, call 800-483-2193 today and we’ll connect you with a detox specialist that can answer your questions and help you find a center that’s able to assist in your recovery process. 
      Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions. Smiling is considered infectious, so keep on smiling! 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
