      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. 
      The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better.
