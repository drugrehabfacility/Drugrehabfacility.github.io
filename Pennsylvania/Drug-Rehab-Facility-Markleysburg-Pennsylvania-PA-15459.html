      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process.In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
