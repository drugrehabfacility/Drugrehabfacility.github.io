      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
