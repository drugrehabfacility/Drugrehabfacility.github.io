      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. There are many explanations for why giving up alcohol needs a critical dedication. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 800-483-2193 800-483-2193 Get help for your loved one FEATURED CENTERS Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 Family is Forever. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
