      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else.

This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms.
