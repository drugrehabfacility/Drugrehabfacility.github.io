      Let us help find the right treatment center for you, so you can start living a better life. 
      Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. 
      Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. Specific plans may have different coverage levels, so it’s a good idea to check the specific policy or talk to the insurance provider. 
      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option.
