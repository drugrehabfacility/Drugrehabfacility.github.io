      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love.
