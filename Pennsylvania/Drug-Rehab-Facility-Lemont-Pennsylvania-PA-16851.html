      My next interest is to save you unnecessary rehab expenses wherever possible. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.

For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
