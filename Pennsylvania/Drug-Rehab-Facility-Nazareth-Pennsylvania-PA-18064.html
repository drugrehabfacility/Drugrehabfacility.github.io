      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      They should e ready on the process that they will have especially for the withdrawal stages that they will experience. The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences.
