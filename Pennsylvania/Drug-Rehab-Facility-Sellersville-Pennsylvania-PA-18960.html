      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.
