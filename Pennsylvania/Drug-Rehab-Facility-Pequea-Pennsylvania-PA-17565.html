      No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. 
      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. 
      You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever!

      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you.Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. 
      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Changes to watch for include: Serious money problems Relationship conflicts over drug use Loss of motivation to meet work/school responsibilities Problems with the law, such as DUIs Inpatient vs. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.

      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas.As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox. 
      Advocate Addiction Treatment Center, Des Plaines (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today For those who need medical help for a problem with substance abuse, it does not come better than one that is provided by a hospital. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others.
