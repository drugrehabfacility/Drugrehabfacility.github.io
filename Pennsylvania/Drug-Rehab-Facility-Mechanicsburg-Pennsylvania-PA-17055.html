      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Neurofeedback – During drug detox, many clients find that neurofeedback helps to reduce pain, anxiety and drug cravings, improve concentration, and restore sleep. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.
