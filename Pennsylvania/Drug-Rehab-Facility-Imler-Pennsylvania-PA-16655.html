      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! 
      Detox withdrawal advice may begin after doctors advices, hospital visits and personal attempts prove ineffective. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Along with this, emotional and psychological support is provided to the victims. 
      Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process.

      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Cells in the kidneys move waste out of the body altogether. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
