      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment. With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
