      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. They will admit an opiate user, but with the understanding that they will have to “tough out” the uncomfortable withdrawal. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
