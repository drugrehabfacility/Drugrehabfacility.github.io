      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery.
