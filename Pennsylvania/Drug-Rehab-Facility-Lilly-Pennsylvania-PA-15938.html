    <p>
      A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
