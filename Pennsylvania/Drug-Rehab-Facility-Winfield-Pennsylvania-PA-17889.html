      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
