      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

      Finding these centers is often just a matter of talking to the leaders of these faith traditions to connect with the resources. It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it.
