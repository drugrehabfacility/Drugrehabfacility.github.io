      Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Skilled and continuous assessment of medical needs during the detoxification process, and rock solid procedures for dealing with any sort of medical emergency that may occur.

      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use.

      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
