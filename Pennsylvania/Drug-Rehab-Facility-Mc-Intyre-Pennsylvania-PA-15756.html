      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you.
