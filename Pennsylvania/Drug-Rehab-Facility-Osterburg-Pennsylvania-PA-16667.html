      One of the biggest issues in the Las Vegas area as well in Nevada as a whole is drug abuse and drug addiction. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. What scale or level do you expect the facility to be? 
      Physical activities: Hiking, swimming, gym workouts and sports are all helpful tools in recovery. both as a distraction and way of making you healthier and happier. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that.

Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there.
