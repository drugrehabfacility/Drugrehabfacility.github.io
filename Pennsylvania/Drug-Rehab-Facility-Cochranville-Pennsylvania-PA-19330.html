      The particular Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois even offers this medication regarding Clonidine as well as Naltrexone through the detox procedure. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
