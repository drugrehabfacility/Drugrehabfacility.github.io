      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
