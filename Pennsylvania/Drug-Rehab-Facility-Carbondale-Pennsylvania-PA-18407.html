      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox.
