      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. 
      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. The 38-acre property provides an attractive setting for recovery and contemplation, including comfortable and comforting rooms, a full gymnasium, and beautiful natural surroundings. 
      The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance.
