      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. For most people, alcohol is filtered out of their system in roughly seven to 10 days. 
      The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications?
