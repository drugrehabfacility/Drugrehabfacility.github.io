      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      The healthcare professional assures that the prescription of the medicine is within an inferior volume. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process.

      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.

      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own.
