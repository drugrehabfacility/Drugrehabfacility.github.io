      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away.
