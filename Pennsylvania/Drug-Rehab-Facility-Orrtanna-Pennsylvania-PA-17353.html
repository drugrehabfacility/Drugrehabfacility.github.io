      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is.

      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
