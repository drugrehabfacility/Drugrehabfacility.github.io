      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.

      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home.The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. 
      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night.
