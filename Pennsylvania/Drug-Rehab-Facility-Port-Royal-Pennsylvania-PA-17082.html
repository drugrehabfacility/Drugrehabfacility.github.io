      Rutherford, New Jersey Alcohol and Drug Detox: Your One-Stop Detox and Rehab Facility Most rehabilitation centers today require an addict to undergo a detoxification process elsewhere before enrollment into their rehab programs. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.

      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.

      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. 
      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live.
