      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.Addiction isn't brought on by the drug, but is brought on by biological and mental vulnerabilities resulting in a variety of kinds of craving."
