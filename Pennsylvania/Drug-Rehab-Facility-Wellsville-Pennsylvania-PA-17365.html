      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being.

      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
