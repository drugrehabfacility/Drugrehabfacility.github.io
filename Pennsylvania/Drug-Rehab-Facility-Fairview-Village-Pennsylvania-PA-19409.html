      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. The standard drug clean or heroin detox in Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts provide full time services from the moment that the person enter into the said program. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health.
