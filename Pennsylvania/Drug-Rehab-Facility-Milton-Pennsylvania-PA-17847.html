      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.

      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly.Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.

      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
