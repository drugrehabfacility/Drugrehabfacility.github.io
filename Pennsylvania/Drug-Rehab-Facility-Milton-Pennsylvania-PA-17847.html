      Drug Detoxification </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well.
