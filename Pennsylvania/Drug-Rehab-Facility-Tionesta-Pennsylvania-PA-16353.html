      If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
