      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem.

      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification.
