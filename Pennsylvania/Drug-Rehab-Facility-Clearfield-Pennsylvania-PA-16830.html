      Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though.
