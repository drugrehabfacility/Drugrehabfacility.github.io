      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      We refer to 30 different recommended centers which can be categorized into 4 basic withdrawal and detox costs. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using.
