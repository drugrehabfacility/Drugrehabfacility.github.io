      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful.
