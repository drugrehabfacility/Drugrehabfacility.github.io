      800-483-2193 Rapid Detox Centers A relatively new method of assisting those who are addicted to opiates in overcoming the physical dependence that they suffer from is the rapid detox method. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. We offer a network of solutions for those struggling with alcohol and drug abuse. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery.

      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
