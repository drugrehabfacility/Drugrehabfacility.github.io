      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control.However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own.

      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
