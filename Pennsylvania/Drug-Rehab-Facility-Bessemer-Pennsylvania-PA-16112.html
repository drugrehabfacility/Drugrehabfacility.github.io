      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.
