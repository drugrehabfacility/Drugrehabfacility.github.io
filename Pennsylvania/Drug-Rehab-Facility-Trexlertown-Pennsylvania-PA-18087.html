      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. 
      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.
