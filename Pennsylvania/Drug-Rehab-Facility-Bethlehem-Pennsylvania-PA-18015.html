      Ohio detox centers understand how difficult it can be to overcome addiction, and will guide you safely through detox and withdrawal with a lowered risk for health complications. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Our therapists will assist you through our world class treatment program and facility, must medical treatment or detoxing be appropriate or needed. 
      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. 
      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
