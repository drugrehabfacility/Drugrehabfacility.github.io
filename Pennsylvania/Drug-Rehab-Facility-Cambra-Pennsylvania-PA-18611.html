      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      We can help you find a program that's right for you or a loved one. Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana.
