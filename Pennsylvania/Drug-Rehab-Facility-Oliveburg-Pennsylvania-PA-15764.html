      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.

      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Vincent Depaul provide free treatment for those who qualify for help. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems.

      We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.

      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable.

      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery.
