      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. 
      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility.If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body.Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
