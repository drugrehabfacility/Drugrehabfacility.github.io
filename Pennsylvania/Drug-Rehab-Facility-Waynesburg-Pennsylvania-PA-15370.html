      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      You’ll enjoy comfortable furnishings and warm décor in soothing settings. Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
