      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. We provide the best, most economical and efficient treatment possible for all who need our care. * Inpatient medical detoxing * Residential drug rehab * Outpatient rehabilitation * Subsequent alcohol and drug dependency treatment The most important first step to healing is cleansing from the compound. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine.
