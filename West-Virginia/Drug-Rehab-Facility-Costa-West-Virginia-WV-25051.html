      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs.Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. 
      At these meetings, you'll find the loving support of women and men that are currently fighting with similar difficulties and discover how they've learned to look after themselves. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are.
