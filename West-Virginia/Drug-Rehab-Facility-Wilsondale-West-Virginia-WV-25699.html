      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. Along with this, emotional and psychological support is provided to the victims. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.
