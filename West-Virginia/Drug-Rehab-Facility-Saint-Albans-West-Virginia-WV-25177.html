      People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      The medicinal aspects of detox facilities in Washington give someone the physical comfort needed to safely and easily move through the withdrawal symptoms due to their physical dependency on drugs and alcohol.

      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. Whether you’re having nausea or you feel like you need someone to speak with, our professionals will be there for you. 
      Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction.
