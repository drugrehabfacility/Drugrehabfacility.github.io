Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox?

      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases.The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.
