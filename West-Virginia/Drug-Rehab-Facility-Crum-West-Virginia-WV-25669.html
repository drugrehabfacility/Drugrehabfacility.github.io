      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. 
      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.
