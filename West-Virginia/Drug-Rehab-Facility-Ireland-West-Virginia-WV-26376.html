      Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. There are also other types of programs available that incorporate many modalities to achieving sober success for a lifetime.Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.
