      During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life.

      This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
