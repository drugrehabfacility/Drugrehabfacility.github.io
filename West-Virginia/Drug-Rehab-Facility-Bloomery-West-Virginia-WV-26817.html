      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
