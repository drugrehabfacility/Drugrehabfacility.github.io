      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment?

Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases.

      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
