      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process.
