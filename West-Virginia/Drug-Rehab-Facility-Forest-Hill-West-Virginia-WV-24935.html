      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available.
