      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Medical monitoring –Detox patients rest in well-furnished private rooms outfitted with monitoring equipment.

      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.

      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).

Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab.
