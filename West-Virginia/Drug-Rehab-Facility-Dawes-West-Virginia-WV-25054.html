      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. 
      Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need.
