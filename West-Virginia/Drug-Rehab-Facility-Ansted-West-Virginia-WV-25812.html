      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery.
