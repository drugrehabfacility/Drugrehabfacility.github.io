      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. It is completely your responsibility to seek out the help. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges.

      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.
