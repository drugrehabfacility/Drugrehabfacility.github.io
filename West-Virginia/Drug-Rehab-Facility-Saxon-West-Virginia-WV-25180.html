      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone.
