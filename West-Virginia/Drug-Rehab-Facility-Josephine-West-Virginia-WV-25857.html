      Our experts in drug detox in Howell often see how lack of knowledge is able to get in the way when people struggle with addiction.  It’s important to learn how addiction happens, and how drug detox works. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab.
