      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. Our treatment helpline will connect you with facilities in Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and West Haven as well as throughout all other areas of the state. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
