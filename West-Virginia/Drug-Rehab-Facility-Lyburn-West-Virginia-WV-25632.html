      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.
