      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine.
