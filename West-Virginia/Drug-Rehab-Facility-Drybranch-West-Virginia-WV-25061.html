      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.
