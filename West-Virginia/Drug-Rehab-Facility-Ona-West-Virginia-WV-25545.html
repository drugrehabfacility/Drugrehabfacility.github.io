      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant.For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience.
