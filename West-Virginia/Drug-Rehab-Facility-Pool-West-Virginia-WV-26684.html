      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care.Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility.We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. This session can e a group or individual session.
