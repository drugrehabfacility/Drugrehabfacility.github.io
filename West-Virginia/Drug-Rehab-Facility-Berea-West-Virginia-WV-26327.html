      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.
