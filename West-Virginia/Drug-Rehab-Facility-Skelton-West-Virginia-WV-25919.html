      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.
