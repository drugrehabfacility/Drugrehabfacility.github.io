      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox.
