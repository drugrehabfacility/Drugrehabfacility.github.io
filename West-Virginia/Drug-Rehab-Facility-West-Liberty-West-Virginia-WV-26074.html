      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      These centers also attain to excellent standards of integrated detox and rehab services for their clients. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture!

      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals.
