      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription.
