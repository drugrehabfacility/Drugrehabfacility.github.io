      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
