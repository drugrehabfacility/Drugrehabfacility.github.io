      If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.

      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.

      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox.Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs.

      Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.

      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
