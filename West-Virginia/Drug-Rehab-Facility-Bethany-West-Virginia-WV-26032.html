      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns. 
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. Further, in the report, it was also mentioned with the increase in the number of Massachusetts detox centers, number of people admitted to these facilities also increased to around 36,815. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process.
