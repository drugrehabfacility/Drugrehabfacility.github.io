      Drug Detox may be achieved without the use of medications, in some cases drugs may be prescribed or administered to ease the withdraw symptoms. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.

      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.
