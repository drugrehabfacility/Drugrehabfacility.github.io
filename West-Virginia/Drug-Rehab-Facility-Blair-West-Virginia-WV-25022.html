      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
