For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.

      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug.
