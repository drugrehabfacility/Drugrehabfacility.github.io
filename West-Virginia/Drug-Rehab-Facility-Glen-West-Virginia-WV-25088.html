In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. For most people, alcohol is filtered out of their system in roughly seven to 10 days. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. 
      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies.
