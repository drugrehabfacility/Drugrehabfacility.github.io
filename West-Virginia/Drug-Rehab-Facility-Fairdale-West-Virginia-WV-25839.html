      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      The most common of these drug detox programs is Christian drug detox.
