      Paying for Treatment Options for paying for amphetamine rehab in Massachusetts are many, though health insurance coverage offers the most comprehensive and convenient method. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      Medical Detox Centers Many hospitals and residential treatment facilities provide medical detox centers as part of their overall treatment regimen. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone.
