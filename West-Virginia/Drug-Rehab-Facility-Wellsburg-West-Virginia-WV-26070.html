      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      This makes for a stunning backdrop and a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.
