      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance.

      After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.

      In order to rate the centers, we took into account criteria like staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and effectiveness and, after ranking and filtering the list, now present the 9 best rehabs in Ohio.
