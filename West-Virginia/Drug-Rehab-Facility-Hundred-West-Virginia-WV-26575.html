      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community. 
      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Paying for Treatment Options for paying for amphetamine rehab in Massachusetts are many, though health insurance coverage offers the most comprehensive and convenient method.

      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. 
      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches.
