      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      Some of these symptoms can be medically dangerous and lead to damaging side effects.
