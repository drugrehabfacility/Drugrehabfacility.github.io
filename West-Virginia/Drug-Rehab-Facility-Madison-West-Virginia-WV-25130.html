      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts.
