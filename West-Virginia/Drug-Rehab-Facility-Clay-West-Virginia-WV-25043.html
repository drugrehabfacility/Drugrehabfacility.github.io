      Connecticut, CT offers some of the best detoxification centers and facilities for drug and alcohol withdrawal from substance abuse. You require help too if you are one of those four. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse.

      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox.
