      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted.
