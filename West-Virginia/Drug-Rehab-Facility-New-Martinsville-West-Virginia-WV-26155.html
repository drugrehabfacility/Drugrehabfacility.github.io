      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success.
