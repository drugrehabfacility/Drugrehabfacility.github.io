      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
