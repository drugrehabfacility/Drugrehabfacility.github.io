      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Massachusetts; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again.
