      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.

      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification.
