      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help.
