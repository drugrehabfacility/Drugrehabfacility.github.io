      Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers.
