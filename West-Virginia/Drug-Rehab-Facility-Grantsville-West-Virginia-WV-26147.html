      If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      You should ask whether the group has a telephone listing. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
