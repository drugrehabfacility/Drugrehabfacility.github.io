      Above the Standard: I believe in only working with people and centers that I personally trust. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      You will get numerous diverse answers on how to avoid relapse such as; staying positive, going to meeting or groups and staying associated to your peers. There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being.
