      Home-Like Comfort – Far from a stark, hospital-like environment, our drug and alcohol detox facilities are home-like and welcoming. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals.
