      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      Your doctor did not tell you how addictive benzos would be. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.

      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      With a big smile and the huge love I've always had for you, I just want to say, I love you ... my darling daughter. Counseling is a good idea for your full therapeutic of the individual. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
