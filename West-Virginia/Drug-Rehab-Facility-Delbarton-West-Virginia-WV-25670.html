      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications.

      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming.Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.
