      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.

      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal.
