      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. State-of-the-Art Facilities Our state-of-the-art addiction-treatment center is designed for the sole purpose of making the drug or alcohol detox experience comfortable and therapeutic. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.

The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.
