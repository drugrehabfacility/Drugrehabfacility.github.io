      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription.
