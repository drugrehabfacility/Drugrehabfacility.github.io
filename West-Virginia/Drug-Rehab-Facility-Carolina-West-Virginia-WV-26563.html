      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs.

      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      Neurofeedback – During drug detox, many clients find that neurofeedback helps to reduce pain, anxiety and drug cravings, improve concentration, and restore sleep. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.

Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people.
