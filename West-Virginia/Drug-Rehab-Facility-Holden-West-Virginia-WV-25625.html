      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Alcohol treatment and addiction recovery are possible through the right treatment facility.All over the United States, drug abuse or heroin abuse are still increasing, that’s why the program of Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts still fights the prevention of addiction. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox.
