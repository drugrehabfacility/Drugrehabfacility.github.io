      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.

      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program.
