      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      Partial hospitalization: This treatment program best applies to patients who require a continuous medical Fairview UT 84629 monitoring, but who are not very affected by the drug abuse problem.
