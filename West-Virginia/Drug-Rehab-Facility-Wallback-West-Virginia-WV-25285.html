      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible.

      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has.
