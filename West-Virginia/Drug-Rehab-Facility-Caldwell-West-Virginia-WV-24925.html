      Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Toll-free 800-483-2193 Call Now If you or someone you love is interested in holistic drug detox, call now to find a program near you. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
