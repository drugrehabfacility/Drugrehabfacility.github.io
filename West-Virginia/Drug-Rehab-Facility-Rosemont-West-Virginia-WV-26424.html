      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.
