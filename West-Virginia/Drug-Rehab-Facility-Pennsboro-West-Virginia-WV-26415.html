      This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling.
