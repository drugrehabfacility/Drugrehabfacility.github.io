It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).
