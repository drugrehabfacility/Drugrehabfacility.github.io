      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      You may not feel ready to give up drugs and alcohol. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.
