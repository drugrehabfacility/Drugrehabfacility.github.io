      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs.

      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly.
