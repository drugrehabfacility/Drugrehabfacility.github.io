      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Like vomiting, irritation, nausea, nostril, chill. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      The rehabilitation process has many phases and for someone to have a successful recovery, it is important for them to work hard and be committed during each section of this important and personal course of action.  Once a person decides they need help and wants to make an effort to get clean and sober, anyone in the area looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities can call Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center at (877) 855-3470 and talk to an addiction counselor to hear about all of the available programs.  Searching for rehab facilities and other care centers, including a Miami drug detox, can be a daunting process, but the highly trained professionals at Fort Myers White Sands will answer any questions you may have about your available options.
