Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
