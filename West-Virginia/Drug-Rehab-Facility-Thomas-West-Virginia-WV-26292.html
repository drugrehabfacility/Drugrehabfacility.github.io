      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life.
