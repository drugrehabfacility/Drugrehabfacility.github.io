Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol.
