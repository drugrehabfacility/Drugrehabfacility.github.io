      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. 
      In other instances Alanon members might be uncomfortable since they've told lies especially to cover up for the alcoholic or to stop conflict. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere.
