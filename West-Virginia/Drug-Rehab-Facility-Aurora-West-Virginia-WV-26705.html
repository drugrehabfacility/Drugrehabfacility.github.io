      You fixded my cheeseburger!” When Lauren walked away, Arianna just sat there for a second and looked at her new burger. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.

      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
