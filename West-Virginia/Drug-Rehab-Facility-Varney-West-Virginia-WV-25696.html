      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery.

      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.

A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room.
