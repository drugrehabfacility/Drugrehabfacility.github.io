      You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Treatment Options in Ohio Ohio has plenty of treatment options that are at your disposal. To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor. 
      Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.
