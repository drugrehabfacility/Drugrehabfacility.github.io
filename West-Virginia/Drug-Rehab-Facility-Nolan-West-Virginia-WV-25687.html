      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. 
      Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
