      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      You do not have to leave the city to address your needs or the specialized needs of your near and dear ones. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
