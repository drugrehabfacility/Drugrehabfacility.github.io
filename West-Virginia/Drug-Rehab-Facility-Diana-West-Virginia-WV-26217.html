Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help.
