      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. Alcohol treatment and addiction recovery are possible through the right treatment facility.All over the United States, drug abuse or heroin abuse are still increasing, that’s why the program of Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts still fights the prevention of addiction. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs.

      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. Ohio Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Opioid-related overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 21. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.

      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control.
