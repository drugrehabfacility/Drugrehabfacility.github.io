      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      For more information on this facility go to www.northlandmbs.com/ 8. We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.
