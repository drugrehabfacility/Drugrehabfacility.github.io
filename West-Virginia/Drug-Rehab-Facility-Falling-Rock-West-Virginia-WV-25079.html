      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used.
