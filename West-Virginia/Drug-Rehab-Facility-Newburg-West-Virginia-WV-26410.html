      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. 
      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. 
      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind.
