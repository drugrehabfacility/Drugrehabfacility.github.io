      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. Decide to interact with others in the "living room" around the fireplace, or in front of one of many large, flat screen digital TVs packed with premium programming.

      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox.

      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided.

      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. While less common, cocaine, sedatives, and hallucinogens were also reasons for seeking out drug treatment in Nevada.
