      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      In the various drug detoxification programs and alcohol detox treatments, the body is purged of the poisons accumulated in the body as a consequence of addiction. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.
