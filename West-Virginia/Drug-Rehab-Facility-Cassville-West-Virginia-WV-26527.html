    <p>
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.

      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake.
