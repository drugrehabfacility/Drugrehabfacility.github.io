      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.
