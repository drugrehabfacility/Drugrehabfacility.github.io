      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Drug Treatment Programs Drug treatment programs or drug rehab refers to the process of psycho-therapeutic and medical treatment to a person who is dependent on psychoactive substances like hard drugs, prescription drugs or alcohol. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. For most people, alcohol is filtered out of their system in roughly seven to 10 days. 
      We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
