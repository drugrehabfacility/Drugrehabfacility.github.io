      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
