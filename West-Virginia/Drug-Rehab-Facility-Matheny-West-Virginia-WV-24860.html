      There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
