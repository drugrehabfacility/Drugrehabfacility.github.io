      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut. 
      Detox withdrawal advice may begin after doctors advices, hospital visits and personal attempts prove ineffective. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
