      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      With specialized treatment programs for teens and young adults, and supportive environments for adult patients, we provide more than just drug detox facilities. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks.

Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015.

      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
