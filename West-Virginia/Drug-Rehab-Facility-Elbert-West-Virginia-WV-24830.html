    <p>
      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Internet gives you ample opportunities to compare prices and location of the various centers in and around Chicago; make the most of the opportunity to choose a program. 
      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.

      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private.

      The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.
