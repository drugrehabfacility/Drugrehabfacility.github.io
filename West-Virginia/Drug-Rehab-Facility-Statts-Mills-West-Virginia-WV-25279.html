      And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.
