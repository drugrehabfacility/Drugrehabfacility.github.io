      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).
