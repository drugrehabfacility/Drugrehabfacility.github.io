      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals.

      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.

      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
