      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.
