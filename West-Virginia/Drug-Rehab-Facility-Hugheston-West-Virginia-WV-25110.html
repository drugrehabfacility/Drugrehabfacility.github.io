      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition. 
      Gin isn’t any faster or slower for the body to process than whiskey. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month.

Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      One of the biggest issues in the Las Vegas area as well in Nevada as a whole is drug abuse and drug addiction. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries.
