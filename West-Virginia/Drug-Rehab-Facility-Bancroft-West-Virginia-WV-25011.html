      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior.
