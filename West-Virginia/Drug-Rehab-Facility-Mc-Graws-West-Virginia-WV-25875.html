      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      It gets rid of the toxic chemicals that have built up in your system from drug use.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.Cells in the kidneys move waste out of the body altogether. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab.
