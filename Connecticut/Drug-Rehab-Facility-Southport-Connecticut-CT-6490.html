      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Like vomiting, irritation, nausea, nostril, chill. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist.
