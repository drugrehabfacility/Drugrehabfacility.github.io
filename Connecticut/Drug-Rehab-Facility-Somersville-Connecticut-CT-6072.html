      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
