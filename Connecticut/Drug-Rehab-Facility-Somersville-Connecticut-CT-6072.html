      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.

Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center.

      For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. 
      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
