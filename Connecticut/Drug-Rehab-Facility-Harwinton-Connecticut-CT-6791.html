      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
