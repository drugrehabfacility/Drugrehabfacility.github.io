      Known as the Buckeye State, Ohio has brought many great things to the United States. 
      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling.
