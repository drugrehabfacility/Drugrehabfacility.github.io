      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Our drug addiction specialists are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! 
      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete.

      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. They should e ready on the process that they will have especially for the withdrawal stages that they will experience. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.

      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. 
      The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification.

      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Our in-house program allows the medical team to begin working to improve your life in a drug-free environment.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery.
