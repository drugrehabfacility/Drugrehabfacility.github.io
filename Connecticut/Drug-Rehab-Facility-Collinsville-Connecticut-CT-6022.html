    <p>
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive.

      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. 
      Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances.
