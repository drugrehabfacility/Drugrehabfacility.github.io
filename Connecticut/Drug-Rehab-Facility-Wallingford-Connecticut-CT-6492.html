      By analyzing this information, we give an answer with the treatment plan and cost of medical services that would be appropriate for that case. An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.

      Stays may be as short as 7 days costing $15,000 and up. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      These individuals may not know that there are options for them. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.
