      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Outpatient Drug Detox Outpatient programs provide high-level care for those needing a flexible schedule.
