      Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. 
      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain.

      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015.The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. 
      The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount.Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.
