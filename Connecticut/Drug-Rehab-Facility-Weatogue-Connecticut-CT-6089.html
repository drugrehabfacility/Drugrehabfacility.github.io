      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them.

      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
