      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them.

      Our goal is to help you break your chemical dependency as a safely and as comfortable as possible.
