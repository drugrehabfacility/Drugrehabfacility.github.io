      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. 
      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Alcoholics do not understand that they're going to become an individual, and don't the folks. 
      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
