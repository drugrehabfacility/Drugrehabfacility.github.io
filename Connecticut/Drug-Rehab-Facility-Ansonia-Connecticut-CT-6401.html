    <p>
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.

Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.

Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
