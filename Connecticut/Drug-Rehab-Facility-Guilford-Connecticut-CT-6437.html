      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers.

Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification.
