      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.

This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away.
