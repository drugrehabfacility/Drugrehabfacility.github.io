      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
