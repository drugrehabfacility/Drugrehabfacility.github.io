      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again.

      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
