      Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Medical monitoring –Detox patients rest in well-furnished private rooms outfitted with monitoring equipment. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis.
