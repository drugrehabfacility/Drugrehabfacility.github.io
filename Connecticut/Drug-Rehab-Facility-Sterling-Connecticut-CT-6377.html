      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.
