      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.

      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
