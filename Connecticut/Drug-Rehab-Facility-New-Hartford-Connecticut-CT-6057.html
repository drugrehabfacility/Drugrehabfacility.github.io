      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. There are plenty of places where drugs will tempt the recovering addict, it is important that several avenues are offered for recovery. 
      Waiting Room Operating Room Recovery Room Recovery Room RDD Center performs our rapid drug detoxification procedure in a state-of-the-art, licensed surgical center providing patients effective results, superior care, safety, privacy and quality. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Rather, we offer an educational cognitive behavioral education program that helps you identify the habits that led you to choose drugs and help you create different habits and a more fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle. Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.
