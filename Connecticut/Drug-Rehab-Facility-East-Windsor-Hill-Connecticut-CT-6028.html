      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible.
