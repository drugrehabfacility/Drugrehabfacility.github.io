      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Once this information is established, if the state deems that the client cannot pay, they may provide free treatment on various levels through specific types of clinics or treatment centers. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox.
