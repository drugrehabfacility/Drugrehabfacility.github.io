      How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Drug rehabilitation involves the following types of behavioral therapy; Cognitive behavioral therapy: helps patients know, avoid and bear with situations which may make them return to their addiction habits. Each individual insurance plan is different, and insurance can greatly help to defray the potential costs. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using.

      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. 
      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects.
