      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Combining natural medicine and care with traditional medicine can be the most effective detox methods. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs.
