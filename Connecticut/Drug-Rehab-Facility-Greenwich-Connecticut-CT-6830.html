      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. 
      When you search, you'll get a list of drug rehab facilities that includes information about the rehabilitation center. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. 
      Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox.
