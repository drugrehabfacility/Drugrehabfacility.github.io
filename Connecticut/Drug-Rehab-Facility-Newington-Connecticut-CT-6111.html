      Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms.

      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.
