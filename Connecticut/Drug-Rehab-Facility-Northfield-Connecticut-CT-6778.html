      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. Call now for more information on drug abuse or addiction. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again.

      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
