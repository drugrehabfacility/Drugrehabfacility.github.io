      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control.
