      You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. 
      This makes create seizures, stroke or may cause death. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol.

      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
