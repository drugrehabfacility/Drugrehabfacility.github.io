      If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      We make the most effective, affordable, top-rated drug detox facilities available to help you beat addiction. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
