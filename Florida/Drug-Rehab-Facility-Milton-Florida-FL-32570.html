While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction.
