      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. 
      The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.

      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety.
