      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
