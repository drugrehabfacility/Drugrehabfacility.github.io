Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.

      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
