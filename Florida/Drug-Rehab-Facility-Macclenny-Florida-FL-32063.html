      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Use the search tool on this page to see the options you have here in Illinois. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.
