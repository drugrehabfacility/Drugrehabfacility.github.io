      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. Let Sober Living Drug Rehab guide and assist you on the right route to a high quality treatment program for drug addiction. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).

      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms.

      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. Call 800-483-2193 to speak with a treatment specialist today!
