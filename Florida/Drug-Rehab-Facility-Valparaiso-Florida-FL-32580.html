      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.Call Now for Immediate Help! tap to call: 855-953-0690 GUaRANTEED Confidential CONSULTATION Being an alcoholic isn't a curse. Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care.

Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.
