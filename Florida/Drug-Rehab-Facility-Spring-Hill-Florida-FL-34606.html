      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body.

      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care.
