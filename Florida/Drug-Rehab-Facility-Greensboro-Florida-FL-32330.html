      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary.
