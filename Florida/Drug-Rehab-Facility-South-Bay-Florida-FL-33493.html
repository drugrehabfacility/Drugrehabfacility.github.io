      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
