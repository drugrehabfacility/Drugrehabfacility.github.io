    <p>
      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Our therapists will assist you through our world class treatment program and facility, must medical treatment or detoxing be appropriate or needed. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery.

      Drug Detoxification </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Simply put, the treatment program uses different disciplines with planning and purpose. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      If you are a resident of Illinois and you need to resort to the treatment programs meted out by these organizations, you will find the Chicago detox centers useful. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort.
