      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.
