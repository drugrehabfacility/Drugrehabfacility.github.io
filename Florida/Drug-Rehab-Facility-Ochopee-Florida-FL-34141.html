      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs.
