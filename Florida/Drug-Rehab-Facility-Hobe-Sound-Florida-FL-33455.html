      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. 
      Each person who has to go through the detox facilities in Washington just wants someone who cares while also somehow managing to beat the discomfort of the physical withdrawal from opiates, benzos, alcohol, cocaine and more. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs.
