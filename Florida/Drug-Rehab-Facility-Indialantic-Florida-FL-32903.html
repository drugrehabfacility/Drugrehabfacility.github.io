      These centers can considerably exceed traditional recovery center effectiveness. "By the age of 20 I cured myself and helped several loved ones from chronic addictions, pharmaceutical drug dependency and life long mental health problems. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.

      Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment? If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. 
      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.

      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.
