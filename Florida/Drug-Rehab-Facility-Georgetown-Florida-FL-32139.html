      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically.

      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation.
