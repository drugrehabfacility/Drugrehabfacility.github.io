    <p>
      In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.
