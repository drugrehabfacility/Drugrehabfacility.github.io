Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking.
