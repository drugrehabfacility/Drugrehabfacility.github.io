    <p>
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      Counseling Individual and group counseling is used to identify the underlying issues that led to a client’s addiction. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. There are currently about three hundred drug treatment centers in Massachusetts.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Massachusetts. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.
