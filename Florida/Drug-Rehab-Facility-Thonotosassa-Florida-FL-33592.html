      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it.
