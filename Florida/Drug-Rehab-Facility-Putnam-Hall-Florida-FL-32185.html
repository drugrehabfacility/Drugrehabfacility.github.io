      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects.

      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place.Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery.These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
