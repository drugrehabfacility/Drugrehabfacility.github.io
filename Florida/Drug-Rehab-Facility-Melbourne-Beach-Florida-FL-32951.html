      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
