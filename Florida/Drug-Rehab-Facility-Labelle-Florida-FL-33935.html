      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. It also gives him a chance to discuss privately those items which he may not be prepared to discuss in front of a group. 
      800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery.
