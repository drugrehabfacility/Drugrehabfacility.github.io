      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help.
