      With a 24/7 admissions policy, we’re always ready to help individuals begin the process of recovery.Our Medical Detox Centers Are High Class Facilities Our program is a blend of medical treatment as well as treatment through the use of vitamins, nutrition, and meditation. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
    </p>
    <p>
      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. 
      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. If you are skeptical of their success, you need only to head over to their Facebook page, where thousands of former clients and members of the community come together. 
      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die.In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used.However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s).

Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you.

      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward.

      IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences.

      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
