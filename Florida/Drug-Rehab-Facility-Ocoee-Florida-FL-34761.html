      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. We can help you find a program that's right for you or a loved one. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      Some of these dangers can include seizures and even death. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients.

      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.
