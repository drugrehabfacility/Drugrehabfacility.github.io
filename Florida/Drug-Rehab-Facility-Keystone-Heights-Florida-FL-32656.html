      Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.

      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible.

      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
