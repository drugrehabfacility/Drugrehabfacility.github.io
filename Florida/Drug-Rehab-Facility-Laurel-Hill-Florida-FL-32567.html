      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well.

      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused.Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer.

      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use.
