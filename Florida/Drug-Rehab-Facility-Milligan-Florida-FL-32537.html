      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. 
      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
