It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her.

The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. 
      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse.
