      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery.
