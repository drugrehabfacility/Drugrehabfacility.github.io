      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Services between different medical detox centers can be very great. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
