      Aftercare Services in Illinois Illinois comes in 12th in the nation for drug and alcohol overdose. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. 
      In the various drug detoxification programs and alcohol detox treatments, the body is purged of the poisons accumulated in the body as a consequence of addiction. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with.

      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey. 
      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation.
