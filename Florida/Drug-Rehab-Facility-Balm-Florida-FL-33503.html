      Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time.
