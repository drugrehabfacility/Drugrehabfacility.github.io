      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom.

      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years.
