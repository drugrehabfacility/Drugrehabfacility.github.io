      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
