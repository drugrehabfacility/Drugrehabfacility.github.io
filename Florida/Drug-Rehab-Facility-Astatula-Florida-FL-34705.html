      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.

      Detox.com is dedicated to helping you evaluate Maryland detox centers until you find the ideal match. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.
