      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem.

      These are often part of larger public or community health agency networks within the government. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body.
