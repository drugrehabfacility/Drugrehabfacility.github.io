      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.

These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible.
