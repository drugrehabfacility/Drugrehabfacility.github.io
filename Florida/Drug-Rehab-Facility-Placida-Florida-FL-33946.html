      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs.

      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.
