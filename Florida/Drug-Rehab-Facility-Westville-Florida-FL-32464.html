      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Medications that Help Addiction treatment has come a long way, and inpatient drug detox centers have a variety of different medications that they can use to help people deal with withdrawal. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
