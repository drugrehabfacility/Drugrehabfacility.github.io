      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. If you need alcohol for your body to feel normal, then you likely need help. 
      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.
