      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      Practicing kindness is as simple as helping the someone take groceries to the car. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.

      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. Methadone detox centers provide professional medical care to assist those addicted to methadone with their first phase of recovery—detoxification. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be.
