      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.Home Drug Detox Drug Detox Programs Drug Detox Programs Many different drug detox programs exist to provide patients with the best possible drug detoxification and care for their individual needs.
