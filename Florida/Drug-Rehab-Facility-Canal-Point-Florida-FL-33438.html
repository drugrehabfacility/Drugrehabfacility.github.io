      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support.
