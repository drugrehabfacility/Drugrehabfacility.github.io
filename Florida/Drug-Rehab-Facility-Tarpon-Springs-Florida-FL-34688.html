      It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol.
