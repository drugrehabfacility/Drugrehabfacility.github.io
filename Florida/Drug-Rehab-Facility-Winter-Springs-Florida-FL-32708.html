      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober.
