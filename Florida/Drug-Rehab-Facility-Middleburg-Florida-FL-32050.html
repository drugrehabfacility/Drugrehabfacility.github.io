      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. A good residential treatment facility will be able to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to the needs of each patient. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.

      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
