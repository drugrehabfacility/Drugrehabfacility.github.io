      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.
