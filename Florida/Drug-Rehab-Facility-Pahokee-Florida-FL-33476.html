      1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
