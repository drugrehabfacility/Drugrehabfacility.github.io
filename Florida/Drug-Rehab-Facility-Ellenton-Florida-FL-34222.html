      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      By the time detox becomes necessary, the body has temporarily forgotten how to produce positive sensations.
