      Assistant For Drug Detox </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.
