      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting.

      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great.
