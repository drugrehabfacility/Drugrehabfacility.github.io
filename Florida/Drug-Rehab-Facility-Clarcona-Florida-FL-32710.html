      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
