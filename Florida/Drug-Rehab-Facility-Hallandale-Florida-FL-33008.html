      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed.
