      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance.
