      5210 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 9 months Ago Salute to moms! If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
