      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment.

      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person.
