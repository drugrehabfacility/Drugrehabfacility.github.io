      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Facing Drug and Alcohol Addiction in Ohio Ohio has delivered many treasures to the United States. 
      You may not know what’s next for you after detox. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches.
