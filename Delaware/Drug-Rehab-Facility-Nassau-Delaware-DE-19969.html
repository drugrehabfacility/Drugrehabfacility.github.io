Withdrawal symptoms experienced by abusers and addicts can begin to experience withdraw symptoms as early as a day after the use has stopped. 
      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy.
