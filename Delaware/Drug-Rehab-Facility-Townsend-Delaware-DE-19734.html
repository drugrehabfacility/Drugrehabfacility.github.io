      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using.
