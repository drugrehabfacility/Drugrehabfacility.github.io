      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Christian Detox Centers Patients who find strength through their spirituality can benefit from christian detox centers. Fill in the contact form below or give us a call. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. 
      Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.

      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers.
