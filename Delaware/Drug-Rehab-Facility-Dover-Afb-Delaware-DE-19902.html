      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others.
