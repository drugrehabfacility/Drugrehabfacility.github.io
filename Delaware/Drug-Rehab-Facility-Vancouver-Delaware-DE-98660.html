      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms.Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. 
      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment.Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.
