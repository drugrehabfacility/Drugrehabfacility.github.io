      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment.

      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.

      The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program.

      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
