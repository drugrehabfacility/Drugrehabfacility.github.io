      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      Our drug addiction specialists are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!
