      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely.
