      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life.

      FREE INSURANCE VERIFICATION We accept most insurances, call us to find out for certain.Drug Detox Treatment Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment for Drugs in Toms River, NJ Medically-assisted detox is recommended for most prescription drugs, pain killers, heroin, and combinations of drugs and alcohol. Opiate detox centers specialize in helping patients who are addicted to opiates and can provide profound treatment measures to assist the recovering addict in their plight against opiate addiction. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
