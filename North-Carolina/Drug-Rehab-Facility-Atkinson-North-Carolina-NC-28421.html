      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. Outpatient medical detox used methadone and suboxone replacement therapies. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. California & Alcoholism Consuming large amounts of liquor on the weekends can make having a good time with friends easy. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
