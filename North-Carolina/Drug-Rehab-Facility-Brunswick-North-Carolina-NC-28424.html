      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage.

Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 800-483-2193 Call the 24-HOUR ADDICTION Hotline RELATED PAGES Family is Forever! 
      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall.

      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means.
