      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity.
