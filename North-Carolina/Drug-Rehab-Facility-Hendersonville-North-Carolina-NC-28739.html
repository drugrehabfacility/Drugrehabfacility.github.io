      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment.
