      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful.

Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.

      The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions. Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
