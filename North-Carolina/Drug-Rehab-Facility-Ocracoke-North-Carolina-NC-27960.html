      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment.
