      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      Patients travel to our center from around the world due to the success and safety of our procedure. While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"!

      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.
