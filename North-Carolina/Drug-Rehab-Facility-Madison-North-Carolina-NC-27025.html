      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs.
