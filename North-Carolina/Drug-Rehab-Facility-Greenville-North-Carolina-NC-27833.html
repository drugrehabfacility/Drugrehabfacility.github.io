      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance.

      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms – Unknown to some alcohol produces many withdrawal effects including delirium tremens (uncontrolled shaking), seizures, depression, anxiety, stomach aches, vomiting, restlessness and headaches. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings.

      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. 
      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
