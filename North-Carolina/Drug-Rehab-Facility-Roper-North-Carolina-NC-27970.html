      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
