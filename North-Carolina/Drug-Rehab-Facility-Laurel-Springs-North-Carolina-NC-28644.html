      You can also choose to take advantage of our in-home drug detox programs, which bring the benefits of our facilities to the comfort of your private residence. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
