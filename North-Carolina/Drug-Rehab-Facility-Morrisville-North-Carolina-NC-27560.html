      Connecticut Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Widespread cocaine use continues to be a major drug threat in Connecticut. 
      Detox facilities all over the country are not created equal that is why detox facilities in Washington give one of the most comfortable and home like experiences for each client that needs to separate themselves from their drug use and drinking. Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. 
      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life.
