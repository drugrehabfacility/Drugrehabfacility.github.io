      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises.

      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths.
