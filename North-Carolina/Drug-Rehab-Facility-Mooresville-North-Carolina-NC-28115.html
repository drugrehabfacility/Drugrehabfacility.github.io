      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.

      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life.

    <p>
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction.
