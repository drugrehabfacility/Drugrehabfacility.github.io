Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor.
