      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Natural Drug Detox Programs Naturally overcoming physical drug dependence is another method of detox that can be very effective and liberating at the same time. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.
