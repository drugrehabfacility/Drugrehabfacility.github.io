      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.

      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Drug Detox Programs Many individuals simply cannot or will not deal with the withdrawal symptoms associated with natural detox. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day.If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary.

      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens.
