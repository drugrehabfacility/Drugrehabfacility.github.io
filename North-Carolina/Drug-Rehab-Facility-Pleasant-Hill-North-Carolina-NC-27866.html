      Find an Amphetamine Addiction Treatment Center As addiction affects different people in different ways, there’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach to drug treatment. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms.
