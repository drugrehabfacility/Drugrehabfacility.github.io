      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others.
