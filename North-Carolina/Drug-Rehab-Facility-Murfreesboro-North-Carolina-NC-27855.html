      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox.

      The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
