      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. We know you are a good person needing help, and we have helped hundreds before you. 
      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs.
