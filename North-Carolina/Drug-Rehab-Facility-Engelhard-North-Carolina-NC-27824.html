      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available.

      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.

      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance.

      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit.As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      I've dedicated my life to helping others gain health and happiness. Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
