      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem.

      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term.
