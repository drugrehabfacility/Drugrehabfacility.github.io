      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.
