      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      I am happy to be here and I know anyone that comes here will be happy too.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state.
