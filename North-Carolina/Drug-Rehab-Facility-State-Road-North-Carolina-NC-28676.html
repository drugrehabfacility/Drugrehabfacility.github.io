      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. 
      For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify.

      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
