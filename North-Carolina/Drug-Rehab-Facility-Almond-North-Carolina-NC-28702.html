      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).
