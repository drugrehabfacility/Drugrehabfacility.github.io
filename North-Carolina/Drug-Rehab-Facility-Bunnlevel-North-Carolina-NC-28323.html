      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      There are many people going through what you are right now. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. 
      Jump to Section: Related Content Inpatient Facilities Cocaine Detox Signs of Overdose Alcohol Detox Withdrawal Timeline Dependence Basics People who use and abuse drugs may feel as though they’re impaired for mere minutes at a stretch.The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use.Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      888-424-2626 A professional and courteous consultant will contact you. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
