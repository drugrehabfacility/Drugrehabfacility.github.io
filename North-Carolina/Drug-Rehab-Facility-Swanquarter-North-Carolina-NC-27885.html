      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 3) Non medically supervised detox facility in Connecticut.
