      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared.
