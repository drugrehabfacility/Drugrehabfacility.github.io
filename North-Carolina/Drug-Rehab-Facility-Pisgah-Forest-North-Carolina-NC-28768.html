      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol.
