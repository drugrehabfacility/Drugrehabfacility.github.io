      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. 
      You’ll enjoy comfortable furnishings and warm décor in soothing settings. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification.

      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.

      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Narcotics Anonymous: A 12-step support group program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.

      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body.
