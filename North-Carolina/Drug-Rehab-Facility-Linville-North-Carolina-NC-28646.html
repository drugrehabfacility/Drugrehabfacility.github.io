      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.

      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).
