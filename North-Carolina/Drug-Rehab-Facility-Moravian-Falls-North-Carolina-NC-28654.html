      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.

      If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life.
