      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      The clinical staff can help each addict and alcoholic find what they need personally to recover. Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
