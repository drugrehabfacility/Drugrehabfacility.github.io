      Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.

      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
