      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      When you are considering a facility for drug detox in Connecticut, consider a service that will not only be safe and effective but will also keep you comfortable. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      You should ask whether the group has a telephone listing. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).
