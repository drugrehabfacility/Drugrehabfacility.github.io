      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior.
