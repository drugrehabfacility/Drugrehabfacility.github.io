      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
