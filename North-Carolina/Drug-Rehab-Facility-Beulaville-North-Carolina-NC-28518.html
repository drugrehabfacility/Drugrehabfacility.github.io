Rutherford, New Jersey Alcohol and Drug Detox: Your One-Stop Detox and Rehab Facility Most rehabilitation centers today require an addict to undergo a detoxification process elsewhere before enrollment into their rehab programs. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. 
      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
