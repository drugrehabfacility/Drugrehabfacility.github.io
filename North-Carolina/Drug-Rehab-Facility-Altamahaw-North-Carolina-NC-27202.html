      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control.
