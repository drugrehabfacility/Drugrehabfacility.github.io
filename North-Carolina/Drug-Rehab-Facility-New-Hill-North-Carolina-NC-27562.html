      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.

      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. 
      Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation). 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.
