      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services.

      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      Not only will they see in their peers the various stages of success. There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox.
