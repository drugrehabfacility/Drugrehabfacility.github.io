      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
