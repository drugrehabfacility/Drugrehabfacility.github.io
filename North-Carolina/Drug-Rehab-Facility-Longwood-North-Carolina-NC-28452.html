      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. 
      There are many people going through what you are right now. Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check.

      Take the First Step to a Better Life You aren’t expected to have a clear plan for how to get from where you are now to where you want to be. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to.
