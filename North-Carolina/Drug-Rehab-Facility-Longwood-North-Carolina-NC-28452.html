      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.

      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Wherever you stay, you as a guest of our clinically managed program will be provided the opportunity of several beneficial amenities and relaxing extras such as beautiful guest rooms, which are especially designed for aesthetic pleasure. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s.
