      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. 
      Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
