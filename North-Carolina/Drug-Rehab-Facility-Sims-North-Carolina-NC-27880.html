      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. 
      While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. 
      Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery! Detox in NJ, especially for alcohol abusers, can take fluctuating amounts of time. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether.
