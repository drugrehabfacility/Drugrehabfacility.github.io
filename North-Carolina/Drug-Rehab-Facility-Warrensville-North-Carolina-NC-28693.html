      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. All care providers should be appropriately licensed and credentialed. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.
