      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day.
