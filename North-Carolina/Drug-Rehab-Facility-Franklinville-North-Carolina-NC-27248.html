      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms.
