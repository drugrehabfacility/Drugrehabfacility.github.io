      There are plenty of places where drugs will tempt the recovering addict, it is important that several avenues are offered for recovery. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.

Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.
