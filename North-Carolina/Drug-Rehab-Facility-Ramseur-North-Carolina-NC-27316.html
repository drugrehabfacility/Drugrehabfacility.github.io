      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.

      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox.Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.

      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. This is why professional treatment is so necessary.
