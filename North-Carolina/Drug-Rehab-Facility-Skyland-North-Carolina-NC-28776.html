      There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Additional time may be needed for alcohol detox if: You have a severe addiction You have a long-term addiction You have numerous previous periods of withdrawal You have a secondary physical or mental condition You are also abusing drugs To learn more about detox lengths in Michigan detox centers, call 800-483-2193 and speak with an addiction specialist. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members.
