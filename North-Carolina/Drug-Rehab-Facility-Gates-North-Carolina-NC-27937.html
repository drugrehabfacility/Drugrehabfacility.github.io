      There are plenty of places where drugs will tempt the recovering addict, it is important that several avenues are offered for recovery. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.

      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever!

People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible.
