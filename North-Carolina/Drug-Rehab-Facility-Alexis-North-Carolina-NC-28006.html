      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. 
      The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.
