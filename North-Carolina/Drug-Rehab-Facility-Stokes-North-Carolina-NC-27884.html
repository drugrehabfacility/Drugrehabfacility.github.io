      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. 
      After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. Amphetamine Withdrawal Symptoms – Often the least severe type of withdrawal users of amphetamines like methamphetamine, cocaine and prescriptions like Ritalin and Adderall experience symptoms like excessive sleeping and eating, depression, mood swings, paranoia and anxiety. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.
