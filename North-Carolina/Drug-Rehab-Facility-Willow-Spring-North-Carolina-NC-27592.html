      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Fill in the contact form below or give us a call.

      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.

      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
