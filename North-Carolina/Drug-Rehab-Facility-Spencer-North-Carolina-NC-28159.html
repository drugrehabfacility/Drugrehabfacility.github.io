      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal.
