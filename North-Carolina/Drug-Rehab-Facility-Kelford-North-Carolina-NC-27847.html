      Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves.

      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.

      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well.

      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? If you’re seeking intervention resources, want to learn more about our programs or seek help for a loved one, contact us.
