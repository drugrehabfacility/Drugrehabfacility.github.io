      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.
