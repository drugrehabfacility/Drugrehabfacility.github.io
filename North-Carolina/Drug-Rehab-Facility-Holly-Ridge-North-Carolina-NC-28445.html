      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
