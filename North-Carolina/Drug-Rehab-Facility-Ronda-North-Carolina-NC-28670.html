      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.
