      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. Drug Detox may be achieved without the use of medications, in some cases drugs may be prescribed or administered to ease the withdraw symptoms.
