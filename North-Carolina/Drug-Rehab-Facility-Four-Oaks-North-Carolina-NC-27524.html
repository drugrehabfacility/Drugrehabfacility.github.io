      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. 
      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
