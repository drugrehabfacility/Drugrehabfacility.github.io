      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Drug Rehab Advisor insures when you attend a detox or rehab program you will get the detox withdrawal advice and services you expected. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
