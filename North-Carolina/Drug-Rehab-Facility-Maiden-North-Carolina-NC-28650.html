Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.

      Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more.Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      A detox center providing the highest level of care will staff medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment providers that are all available to clients.
