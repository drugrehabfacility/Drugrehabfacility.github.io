      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
