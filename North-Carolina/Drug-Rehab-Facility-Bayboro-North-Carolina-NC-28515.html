      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery.
