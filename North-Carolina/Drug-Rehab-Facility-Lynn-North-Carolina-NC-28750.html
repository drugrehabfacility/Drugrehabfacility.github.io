      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated with Drug Detox Each drug affects the brain in a different way. It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.
