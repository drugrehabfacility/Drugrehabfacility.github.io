    <p>
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time.
