      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs.
