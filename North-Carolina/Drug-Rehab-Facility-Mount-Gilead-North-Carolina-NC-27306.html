      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings.When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
