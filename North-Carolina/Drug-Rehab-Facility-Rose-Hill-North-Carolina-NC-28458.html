      The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms. 
      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober?
