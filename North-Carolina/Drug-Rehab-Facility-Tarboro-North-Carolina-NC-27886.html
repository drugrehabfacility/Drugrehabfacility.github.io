      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
