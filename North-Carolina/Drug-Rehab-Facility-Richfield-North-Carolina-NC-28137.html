      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered.12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      A growing number of drug treatment centers in Connecticut have services for the hearing impaired. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Connecticut Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Widespread cocaine use continues to be a major drug threat in Connecticut.
