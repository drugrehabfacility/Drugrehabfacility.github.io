      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option.

      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use.
