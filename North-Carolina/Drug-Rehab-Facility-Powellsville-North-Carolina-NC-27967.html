      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful?
