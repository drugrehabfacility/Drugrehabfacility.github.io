      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. 
      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun.
