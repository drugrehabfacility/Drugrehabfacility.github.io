      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. 
      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness.

Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
