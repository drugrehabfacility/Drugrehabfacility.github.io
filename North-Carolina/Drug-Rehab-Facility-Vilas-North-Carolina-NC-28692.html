      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. A detox center providing the highest level of care will staff medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment providers that are all available to clients. 
      In the various Hartford drug detox centers, there are programs available for drug detoxification in inpatient as well as outpatient environments. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine.

      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. 
      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. Call 800-483-2193 to speak with a treatment specialist today! 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.
