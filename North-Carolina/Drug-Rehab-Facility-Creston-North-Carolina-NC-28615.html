      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. We provide the best, most economical and efficient treatment possible for all who need our care. * Inpatient medical detoxing * Residential drug rehab * Outpatient rehabilitation * Subsequent alcohol and drug dependency treatment The most important first step to healing is cleansing from the compound. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency.
