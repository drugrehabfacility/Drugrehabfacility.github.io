      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Drug Detox Programs Many individuals simply cannot or will not deal with the withdrawal symptoms associated with natural detox.
