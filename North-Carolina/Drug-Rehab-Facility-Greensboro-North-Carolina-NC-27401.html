      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success.

      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.
