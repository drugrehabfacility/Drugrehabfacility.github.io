Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      Medical monitoring –Detox patients rest in well-furnished private rooms outfitted with monitoring equipment. These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio.
