      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.
