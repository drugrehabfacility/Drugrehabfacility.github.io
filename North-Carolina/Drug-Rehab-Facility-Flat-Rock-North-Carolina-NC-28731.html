      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      These symptoms can be either physical or psychological in nature, and vary according to a number of different factors including: How long the individual has been addicted to the drug Whether or not the individual was addicted to more than one drug The amount of drugs that the individual used per day The physiological makeup of the individual Among the most common physical detox withdrawal symptoms are: Achiness (aching joints or extremities) Chills and sweats (the individual feels as if he or she has the flu) Nausea (another flu-like symptoms) Restless leg syndrome Sleeplessness In addition to these physical conditions, there are also a number of psychological withdrawal symptoms associated with detoxification, including: Irritability and mood swings Depression Anxiety Nervousness Why Do These Withdrawal Symptoms Occur?This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are.

    <p>
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call.
