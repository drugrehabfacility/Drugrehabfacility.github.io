      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.
