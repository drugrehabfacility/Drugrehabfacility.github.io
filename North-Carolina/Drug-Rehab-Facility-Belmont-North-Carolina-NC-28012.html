      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs? 
      It is completely your responsibility to seek out the help. Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio.

      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs.
