The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender.

      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Drug rehabilitation involves the following types of behavioral therapy; Cognitive behavioral therapy: helps patients know, avoid and bear with situations which may make them return to their addiction habits. Call us today and take the first step towards recovery.Our detox procedure is performed in a licensed, state-of-the-art surgical facility. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs.Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
