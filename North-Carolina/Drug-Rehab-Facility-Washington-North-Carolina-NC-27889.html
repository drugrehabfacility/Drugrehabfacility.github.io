      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Massachusetts; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery.

      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility.
