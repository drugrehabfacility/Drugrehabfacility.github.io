      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.
