      With so much contrast and such a tourist-driven city at the state’s core, it comes as no surprise that people in the Nevada area do have their fair share (and sometime more than their fair share) of challenges and struggles. Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety.

      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death.
