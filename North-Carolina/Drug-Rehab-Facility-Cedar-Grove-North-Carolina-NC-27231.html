      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. 
      Our treatment helpline will connect you with facilities in Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and West Haven as well as throughout all other areas of the state. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. 
      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions.
