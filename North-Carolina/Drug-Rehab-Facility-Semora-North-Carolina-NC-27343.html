Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context.

    <p>
      Those who get treated and then quit going to meetings since they believe they're " cured " almost always return to drinking eventually. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients.

      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. A growing number of drug treatment centers in Connecticut have services for the hearing impaired.
