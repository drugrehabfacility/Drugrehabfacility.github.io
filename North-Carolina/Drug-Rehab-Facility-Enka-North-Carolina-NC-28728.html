      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois.

It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center.
