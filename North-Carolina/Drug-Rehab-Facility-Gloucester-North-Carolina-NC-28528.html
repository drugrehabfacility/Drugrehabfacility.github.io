      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction.
