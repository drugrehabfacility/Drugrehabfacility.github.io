Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone.
