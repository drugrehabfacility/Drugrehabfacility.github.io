      Follow is a list of the common benefits and disadvantages of inpatient and outpatient detox. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 5 Signs Inpatient Drug Detox is Right for You CALL FOR HELP! 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.

      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction.
