      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
