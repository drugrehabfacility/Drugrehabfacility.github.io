      Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function.
