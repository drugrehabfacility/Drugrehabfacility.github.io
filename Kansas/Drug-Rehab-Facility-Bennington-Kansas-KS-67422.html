      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable.
