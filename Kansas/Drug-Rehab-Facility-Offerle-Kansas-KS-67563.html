      Individual Attention The small size of our program, coupled with our high staff-to-client ratio, ensures that each client receives the highest level of individual attention during their alcohol or drug detox treatment. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling.

      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. Once this information is established, if the state deems that the client cannot pay, they may provide free treatment on various levels through specific types of clinics or treatment centers. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities.
