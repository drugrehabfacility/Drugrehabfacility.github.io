      Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox.According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. 
      Medications that Help Addiction treatment has come a long way, and inpatient drug detox centers have a variety of different medications that they can use to help people deal with withdrawal. Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention.All of our Massachusetts rehab facilities give you the results you need to live a beautiful life, free from your addiction!Detoxification is an important first step on the road of recovery for an individual addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.
