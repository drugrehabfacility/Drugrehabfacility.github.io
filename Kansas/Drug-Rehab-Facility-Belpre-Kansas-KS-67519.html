      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      Our drug addiction specialists are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!

I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.
