      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision.
