      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system.
