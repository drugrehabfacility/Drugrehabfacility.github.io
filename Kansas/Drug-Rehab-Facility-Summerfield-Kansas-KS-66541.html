      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. 
      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult.
