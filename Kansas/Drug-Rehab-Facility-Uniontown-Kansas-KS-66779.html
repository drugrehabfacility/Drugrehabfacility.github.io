      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs.

      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
