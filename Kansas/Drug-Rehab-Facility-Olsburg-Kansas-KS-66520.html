      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Neurofeedback – During drug detox, many clients find that neurofeedback helps to reduce pain, anxiety and drug cravings, improve concentration, and restore sleep. 
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. 
      They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities.

      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Do you want to get more exposure to people looking for your services in your city? Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares.

      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. 
      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health.
