      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Methadone detox centers provide professional medical care to assist those addicted to methadone with their first phase of recovery—detoxification. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction.
