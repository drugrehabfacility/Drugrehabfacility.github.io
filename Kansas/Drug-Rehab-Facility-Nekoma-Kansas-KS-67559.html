      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares.
