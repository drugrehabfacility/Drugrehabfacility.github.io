      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.

      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). This will make finding exactly what you need at the nearest drug detox center facility to your family. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. Successful Detox: This means you'll get the most care from integrative holistic and medical detox providers who specialize in natural care methods. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.

      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
