      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? 
      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Can I get a private room during my stay in detox?
