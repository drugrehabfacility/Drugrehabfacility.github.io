      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs.

      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.

      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
