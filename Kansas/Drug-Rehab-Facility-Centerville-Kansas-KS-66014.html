      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort.
