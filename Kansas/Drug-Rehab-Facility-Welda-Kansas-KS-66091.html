      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox.
