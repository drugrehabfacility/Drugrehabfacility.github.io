      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. 
      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.

      Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before.
