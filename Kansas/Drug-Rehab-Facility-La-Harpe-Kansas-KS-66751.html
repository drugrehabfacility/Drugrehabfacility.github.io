      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there?

      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
