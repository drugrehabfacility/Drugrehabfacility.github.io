      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.
