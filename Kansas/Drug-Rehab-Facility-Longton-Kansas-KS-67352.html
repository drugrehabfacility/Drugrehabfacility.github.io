Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Drug Detox Programs Many individuals simply cannot or will not deal with the withdrawal symptoms associated with natural detox. They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
