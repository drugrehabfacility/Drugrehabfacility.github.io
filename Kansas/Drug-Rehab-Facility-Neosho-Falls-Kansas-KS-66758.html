      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question.
