      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
