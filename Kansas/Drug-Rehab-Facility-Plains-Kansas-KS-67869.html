      31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment. 
      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective.
