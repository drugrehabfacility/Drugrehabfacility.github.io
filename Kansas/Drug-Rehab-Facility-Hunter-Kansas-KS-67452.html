      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. In some cases, withdrawl can put your life at risk. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.
