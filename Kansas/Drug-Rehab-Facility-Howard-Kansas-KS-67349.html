      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far.
