      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.
