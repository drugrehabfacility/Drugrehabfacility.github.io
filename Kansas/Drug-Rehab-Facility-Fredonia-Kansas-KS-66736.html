      This can be seen in the cultural festivals, architecture, and history museums around the city. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. 
      With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers.
