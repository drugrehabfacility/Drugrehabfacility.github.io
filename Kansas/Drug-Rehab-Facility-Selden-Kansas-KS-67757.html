      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so.
