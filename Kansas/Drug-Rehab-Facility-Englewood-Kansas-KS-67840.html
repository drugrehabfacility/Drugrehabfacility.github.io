      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse.
