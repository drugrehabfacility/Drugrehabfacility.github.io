      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community. 
      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. 
      Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities.
