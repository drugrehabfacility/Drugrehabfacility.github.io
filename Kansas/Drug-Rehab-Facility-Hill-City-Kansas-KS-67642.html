      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation. 
      About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox.
