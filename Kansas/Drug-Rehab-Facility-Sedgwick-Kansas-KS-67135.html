      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring.Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. Red Rock Canyon is a great place to go hiking and climbing or you can head out to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam for tours and boating. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal.

Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
