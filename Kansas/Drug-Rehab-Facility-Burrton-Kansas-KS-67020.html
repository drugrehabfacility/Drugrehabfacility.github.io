      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Call 8667373570 Speak with our admissions counselor Fill out my online form.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.

      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results.
