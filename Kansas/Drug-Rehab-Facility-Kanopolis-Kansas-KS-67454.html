      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs.
