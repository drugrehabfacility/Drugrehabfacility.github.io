      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses.

      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
