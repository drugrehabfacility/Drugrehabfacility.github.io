      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
