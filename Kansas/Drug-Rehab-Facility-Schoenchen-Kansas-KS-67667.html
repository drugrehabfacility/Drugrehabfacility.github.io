      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Call us now, so we can help find the best path for you today. 
      When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse.
