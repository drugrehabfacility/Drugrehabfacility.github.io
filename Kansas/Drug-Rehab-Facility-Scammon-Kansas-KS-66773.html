      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration.
