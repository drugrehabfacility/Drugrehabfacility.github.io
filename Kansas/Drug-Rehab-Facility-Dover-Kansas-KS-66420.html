      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      You may discover there are some meetings in your city that provide babysitting that is totally free. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.
