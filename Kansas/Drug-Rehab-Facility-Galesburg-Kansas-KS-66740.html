      High Drug Use In Connecticut According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Connecticut has one of the highest percentages for drug use in the United States. Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV.

      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower. 
      Correct healthy detox & withdrawal programs ensures that detox is wonderfully successful and healthy. The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.
