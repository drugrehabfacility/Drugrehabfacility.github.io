      How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications? 
      14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 2 months Ago Learn More about our 2 Special Guests, Chris Herren & Bill Reynolds! Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.
