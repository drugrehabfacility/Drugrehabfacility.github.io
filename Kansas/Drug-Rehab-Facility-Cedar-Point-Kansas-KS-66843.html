      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain.
