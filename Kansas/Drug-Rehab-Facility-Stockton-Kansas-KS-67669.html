      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      4) Methadone Clinic in Connecticut: A methadone clinic is not actually a “detox”, although methadone is sometimes used to help someone to stop using opiates. The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings.
