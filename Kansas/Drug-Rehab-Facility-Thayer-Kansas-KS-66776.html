      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services.Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.

      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. Compare the results that are listed and if possible, have a personal chat with the ones you like best.
