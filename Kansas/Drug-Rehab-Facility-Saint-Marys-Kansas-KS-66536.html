      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal.
