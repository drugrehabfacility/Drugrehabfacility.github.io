      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. 
      When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing.Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.

      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use.
