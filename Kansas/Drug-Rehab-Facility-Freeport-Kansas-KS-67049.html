      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles!
