      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. Alcohol detox in Ohio can last as little as three or four days, or up to several weeks for those fighting a severe or long-term addiction. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else.
