      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause.
