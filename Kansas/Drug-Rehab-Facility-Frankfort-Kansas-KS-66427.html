    <p>
      According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. There are currently about three hundred drug treatment centers in Massachusetts.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Massachusetts. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go.

      With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program.

      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Some of these symptoms can be medically dangerous and lead to damaging side effects. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable.Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted.

Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in.

      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
