    </p>
    <p>
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle.
