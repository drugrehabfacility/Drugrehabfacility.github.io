      By putting the same effort in to your recovery that you did into your addiction you can reach addiction recovery. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. 
      This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling.

      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
