      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight.

Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.
