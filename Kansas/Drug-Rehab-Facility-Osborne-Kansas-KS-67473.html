      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
