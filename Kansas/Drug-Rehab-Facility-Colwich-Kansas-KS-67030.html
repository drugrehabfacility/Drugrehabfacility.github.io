      The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
