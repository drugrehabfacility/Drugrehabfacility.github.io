      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better.Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do.Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.
