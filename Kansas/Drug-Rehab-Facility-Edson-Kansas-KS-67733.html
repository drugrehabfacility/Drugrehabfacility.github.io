      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone.

      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.

      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling.

Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
