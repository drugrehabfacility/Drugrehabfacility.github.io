      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. 
      These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
