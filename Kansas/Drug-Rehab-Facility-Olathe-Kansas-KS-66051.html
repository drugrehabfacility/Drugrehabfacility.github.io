      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.

Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight.
