      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      In the United States, it's the most prevalent of the addictions of the nation. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Drug Treatment Programs Drug treatment programs or drug rehab refers to the process of psycho-therapeutic and medical treatment to a person who is dependent on psychoactive substances like hard drugs, prescription drugs or alcohol.
