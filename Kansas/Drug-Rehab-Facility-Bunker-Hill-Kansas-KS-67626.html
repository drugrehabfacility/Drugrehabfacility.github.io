      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
