      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal. Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance.

If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment? 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.
