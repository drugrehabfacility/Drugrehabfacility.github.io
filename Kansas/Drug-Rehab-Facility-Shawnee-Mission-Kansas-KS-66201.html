      Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Soft Landing Recovery, Oakbrook Terrace (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Soft Landing Recovery has an “at home” outpatient recovery that specializes in helping those with addiction to painkillers and opiates. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.
