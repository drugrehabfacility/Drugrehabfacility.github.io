      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Ohio is one of the five national states with the highest rate of overdose deaths.

      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery.
