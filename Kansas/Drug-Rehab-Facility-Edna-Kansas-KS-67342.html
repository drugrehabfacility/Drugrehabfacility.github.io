      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery.

According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused.
