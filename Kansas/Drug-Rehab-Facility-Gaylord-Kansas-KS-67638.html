      Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior.
