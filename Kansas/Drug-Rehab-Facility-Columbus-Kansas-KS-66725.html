      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs.
