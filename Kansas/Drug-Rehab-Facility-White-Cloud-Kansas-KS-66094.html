      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it.

      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts.

      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings.

      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time.Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.
