      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment? 
      These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.
