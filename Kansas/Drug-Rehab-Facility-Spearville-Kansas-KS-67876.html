      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.
