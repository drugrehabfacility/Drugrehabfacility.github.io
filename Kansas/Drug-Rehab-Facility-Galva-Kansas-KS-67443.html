      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day.
