      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      All of our Massachusetts rehab facilities give you the results you need to live a beautiful life, free from your addiction!Detoxification is an important first step on the road of recovery for an individual addicted to drugs or alcohol. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?
