      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      Timberline Knolls, Lemont (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Aimed specifically at women, Timberline Knolls is a residential treatment center that helps with substance abuse as well as other issues such as trauma and PTSD, mood disorders, and eating disorders. Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      It does not have sympathy for any one race, gender, nation or background.

      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse.

      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
