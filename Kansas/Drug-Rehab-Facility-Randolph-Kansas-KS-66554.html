      There are many Illinois Detox Centers Services able to help people suffering from substance abuse. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab.
