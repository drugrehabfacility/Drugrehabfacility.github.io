      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.
