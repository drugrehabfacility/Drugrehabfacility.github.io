      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. 
      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal. It is always advisable to inquire about scholarships or grants available for low-income individuals when seeking a treatment center.

      Find a drug or #alcohol detox program that's right for you or a loved one. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you.The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.

      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. What worked for me were the awesome social activities and the involvement of my instructor.
