      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.
