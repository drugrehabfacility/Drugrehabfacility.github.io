      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. All in-patient detox centers offer medically supervised care by either medical professionals closely monitoring a detox or by holistic detox specialists providing 24/7 attention under the guidance of detox doctors. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.
