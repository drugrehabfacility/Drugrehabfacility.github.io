      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects.

      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable.
