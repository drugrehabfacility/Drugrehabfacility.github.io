      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
