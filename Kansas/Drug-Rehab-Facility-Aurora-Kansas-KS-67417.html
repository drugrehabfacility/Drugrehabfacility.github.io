      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
