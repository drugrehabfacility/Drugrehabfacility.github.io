      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. 
      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.

      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.
