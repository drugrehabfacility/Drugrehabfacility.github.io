      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention.
