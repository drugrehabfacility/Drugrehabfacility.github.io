      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? 
      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. Specific plans may have different coverage levels, so it’s a good idea to check the specific policy or talk to the insurance provider.
