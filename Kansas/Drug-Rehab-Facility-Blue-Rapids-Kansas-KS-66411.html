      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members.
