      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less. (AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse.

      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive.The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
