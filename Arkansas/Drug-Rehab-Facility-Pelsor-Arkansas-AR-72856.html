      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem.

      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run.
