      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
