      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind.
