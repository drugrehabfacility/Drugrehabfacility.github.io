      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.
