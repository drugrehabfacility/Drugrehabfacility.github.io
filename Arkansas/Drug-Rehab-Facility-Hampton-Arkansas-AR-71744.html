      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. 
      Decide to interact with others in the "living room" around the fireplace, or in front of one of many large, flat screen digital TVs packed with premium programming. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem.
