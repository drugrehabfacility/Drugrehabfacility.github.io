      When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids.
