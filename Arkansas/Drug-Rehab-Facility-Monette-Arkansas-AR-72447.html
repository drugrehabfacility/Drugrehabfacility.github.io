      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program.
