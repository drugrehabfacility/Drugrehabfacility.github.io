    <p>
      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. 
      Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful.
