      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink.
