      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. Living a Life of Recovery There are millions of people in the world who are struggling with substance use disorders. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Christian Detox Centers Patients who find strength through their spirituality can benefit from christian detox centers. 
      State-Funded Rehab Most states provide funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation services through public mental health or substance abuse treatment centers that can be accessed by those with no insurance or no income.
