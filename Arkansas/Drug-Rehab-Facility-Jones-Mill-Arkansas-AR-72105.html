      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      We know what it takes to break free of substance use, and we support you 24/7 with on-site nursing staff, top-shelf meals for proper nutrition,  and everything you need to succeed with your detox.Testimonial: I couldn’t stop using – it’s as simple as that; I called Treatment Center Finder and they got me right into drug detox! -Billie J.
