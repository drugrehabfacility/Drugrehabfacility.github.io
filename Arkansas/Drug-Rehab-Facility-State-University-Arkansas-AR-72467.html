      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. This session can e a group or individual session. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 2 months Ago Learn More about our 2 Special Guests, Chris Herren & Bill Reynolds!

Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 2 percent of admissions to addiction treatment were for outpatient detox, 0.
