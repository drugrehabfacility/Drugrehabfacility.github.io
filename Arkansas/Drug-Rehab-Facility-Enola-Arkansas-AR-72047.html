      Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.
