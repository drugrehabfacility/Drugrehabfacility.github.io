      Finding Substance Abuse Treatment In Illinois Illinois has such deep and rich history within the United States, spanning from the historic Route 66 running through the state, to the iconic memorials of Abraham Lincoln. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system.
