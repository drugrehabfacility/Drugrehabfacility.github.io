      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins.

The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it.
