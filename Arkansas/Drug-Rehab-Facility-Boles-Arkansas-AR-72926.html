      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.

      Rapid Detox Versus Traditional Detox Free Detox Centers Some people just can’t afford any type of treatment for their addiction. 
      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal.
