      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.
