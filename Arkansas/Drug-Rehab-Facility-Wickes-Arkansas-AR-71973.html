      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. With a big smile and the huge love I've always had for you, I just want to say, I love you ... my darling daughter. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. 
      Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world.
