      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant.
