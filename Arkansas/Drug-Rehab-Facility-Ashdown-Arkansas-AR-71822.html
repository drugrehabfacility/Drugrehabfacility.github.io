      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term.

      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox.
