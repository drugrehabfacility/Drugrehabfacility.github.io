      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      They are searching for the same high that the pills gave them. Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.

      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab.
