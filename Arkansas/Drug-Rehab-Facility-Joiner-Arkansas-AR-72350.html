      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients.Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay.
