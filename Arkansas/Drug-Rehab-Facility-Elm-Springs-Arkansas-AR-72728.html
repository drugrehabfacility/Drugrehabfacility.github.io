      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      Our advisors are on call to answer any questions on the costs of detox facilities and addiction treatment programs in Connecticut, CT, including coverage for private healthcare and medical insurance. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. All of our Massachusetts rehab facilities give you the results you need to live a beautiful life, free from your addiction!Detoxification is an important first step on the road of recovery for an individual addicted to drugs or alcohol.
