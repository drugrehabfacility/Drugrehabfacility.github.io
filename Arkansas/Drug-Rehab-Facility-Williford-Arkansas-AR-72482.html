      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
