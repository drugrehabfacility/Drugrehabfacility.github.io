      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse.
