      Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Services between different medical detox centers can be very great. Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Call today and speak to a treatment counselor about rehabilitation. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.

      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause.
