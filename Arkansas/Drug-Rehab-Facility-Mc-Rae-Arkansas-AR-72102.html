      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. Rapid Drug Detox Center benchmarks the quality of care to ensure it is higher than the national standard and the best in the nation. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction.
