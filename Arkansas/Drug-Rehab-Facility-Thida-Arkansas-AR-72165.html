      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      Medical monitoring and physical care are provided as well as meals, social support and other services to ensure the safety and sobriety of the individual. Whether you are looking for a drug detox in Boston or any other area, we can help.
