      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      By analyzing this information, we give an answer with the treatment plan and cost of medical services that would be appropriate for that case.
