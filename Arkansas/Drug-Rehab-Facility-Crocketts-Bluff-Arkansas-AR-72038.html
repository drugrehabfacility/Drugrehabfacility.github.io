      1) Inpatient Hospitalization in Connecticut– An inpatient hospitilzation is a brief stay at an actual hospital. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good.
