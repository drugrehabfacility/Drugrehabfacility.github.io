      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. 
      This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. 
      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly.

      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics.
