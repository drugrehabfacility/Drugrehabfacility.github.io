      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative. This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services.
