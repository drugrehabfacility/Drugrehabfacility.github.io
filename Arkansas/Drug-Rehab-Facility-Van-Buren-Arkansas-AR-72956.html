      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      Living a Life of Recovery There are millions of people in the world who are struggling with substance use disorders. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      All others are not considered regardless of media hype.
