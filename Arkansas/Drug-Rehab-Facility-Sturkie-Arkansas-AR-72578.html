      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. That’s why we’re here – to guide you along the path to recovery, one step at a time. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable.
