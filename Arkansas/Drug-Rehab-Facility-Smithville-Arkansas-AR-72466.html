      When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered.

      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
