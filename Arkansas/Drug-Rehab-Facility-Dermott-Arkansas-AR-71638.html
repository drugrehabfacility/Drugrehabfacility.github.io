      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. 
      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve.
