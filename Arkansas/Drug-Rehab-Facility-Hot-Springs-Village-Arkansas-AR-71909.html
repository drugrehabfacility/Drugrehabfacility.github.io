      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.
