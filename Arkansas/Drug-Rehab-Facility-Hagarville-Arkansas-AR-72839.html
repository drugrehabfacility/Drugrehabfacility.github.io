      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Personal events, trauma and the environment does affect drug use. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program.
