      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Benzodiazepine Rehab & Detox, Pharmaceutical & Alcohol Rehab Difficulty withdrawing from harmful drugs or alcohol is the major barrier to happiness and health and getting yourself back. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit.
