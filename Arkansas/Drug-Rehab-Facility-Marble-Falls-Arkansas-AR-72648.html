      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. 
      Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that.

      Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.
