      RDD Center admits patients to our licensed surgical facility for the detoxification procedure to guarantee the proper monitoring and medical care. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse.
