      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
