      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.
