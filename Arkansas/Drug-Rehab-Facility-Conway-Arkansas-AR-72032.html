      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. 
      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction.
