      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. 
      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs.
