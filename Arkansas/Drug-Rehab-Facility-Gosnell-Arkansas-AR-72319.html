      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.

      Round-the-Clock Care – You’ll be monitored around the clock by staff that will check vital signs and make sure that you feel comfortable and cared for. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something.
