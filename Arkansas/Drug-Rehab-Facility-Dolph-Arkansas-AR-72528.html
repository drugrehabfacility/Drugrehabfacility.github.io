      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Willow Springs offers customized treatment based on your needs, with expert staff, including medical practitioners, psycho- and physical therapists, nutritionists and spiritual guides. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have.
