      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety.Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
