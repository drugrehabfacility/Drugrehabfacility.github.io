      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction.
