      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
