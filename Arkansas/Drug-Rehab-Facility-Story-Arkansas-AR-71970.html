      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.Benzo and Alcohol Detox and Rehab Withdrawal Advice from the Drug Rehab Advisor People needing benzo detox withdrawal advice are caught in a trap. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.
