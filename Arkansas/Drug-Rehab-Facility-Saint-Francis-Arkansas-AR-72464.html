      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated.
