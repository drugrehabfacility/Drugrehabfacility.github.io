      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.

      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time.
