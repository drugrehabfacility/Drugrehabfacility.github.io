      In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body. 
      This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      After Detox Some individuals find it necessary to enroll in an after program after drug detox is completed to help you rebuild your life. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist. For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
