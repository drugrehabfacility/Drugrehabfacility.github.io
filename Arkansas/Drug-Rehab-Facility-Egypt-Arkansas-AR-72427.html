      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense.
