      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      You should ask whether the group has a telephone listing. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.

      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.
