      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Detox withdrawal advice may begin after doctors advices, hospital visits and personal attempts prove ineffective.
