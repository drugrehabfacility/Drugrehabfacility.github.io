      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms.
