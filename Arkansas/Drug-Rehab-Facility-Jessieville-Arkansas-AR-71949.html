      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences.
