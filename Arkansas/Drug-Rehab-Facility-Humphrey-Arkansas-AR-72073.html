      115 Alpha Center chesterfield,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday! It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Treatment Center Finder will connect you with the right Massachusetts rehab for you or your loved one. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others.
