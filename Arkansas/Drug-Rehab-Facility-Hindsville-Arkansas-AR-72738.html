      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? 
      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse.

      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function.
