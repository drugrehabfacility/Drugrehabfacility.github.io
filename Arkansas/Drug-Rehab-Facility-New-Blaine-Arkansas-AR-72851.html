      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. Along with this, emotional and psychological support is provided to the victims. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing. 
      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox.
