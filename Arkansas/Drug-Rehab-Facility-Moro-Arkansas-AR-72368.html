      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state.
