      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.

      Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.
