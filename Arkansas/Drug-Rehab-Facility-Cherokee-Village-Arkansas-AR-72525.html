      Finding these centers is often just a matter of talking to the leaders of these faith traditions to connect with the resources. According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. 
      The alcoholic has lost the selection of will in regards to drinking. Let us help find a program that suits your needs. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.

      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. 
      A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington.
