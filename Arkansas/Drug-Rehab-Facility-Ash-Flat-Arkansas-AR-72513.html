      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. 
      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
