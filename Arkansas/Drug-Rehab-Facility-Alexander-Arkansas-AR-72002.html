      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it.
