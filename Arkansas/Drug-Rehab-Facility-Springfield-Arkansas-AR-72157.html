      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. With lovely rural areas and bustling industrious cities, there is much to see and do no matter if you love the city life or the country life. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification.
