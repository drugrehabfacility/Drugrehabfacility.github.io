      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. Community-based programs sponsored by organizations like the Salvation Army and St. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.

    <p>
      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
