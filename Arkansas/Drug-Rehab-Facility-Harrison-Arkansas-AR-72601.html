      High Drug Use In Connecticut According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Connecticut has one of the highest percentages for drug use in the United States. Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community.

In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own.
