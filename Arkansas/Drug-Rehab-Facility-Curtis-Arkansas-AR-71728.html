      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing.
