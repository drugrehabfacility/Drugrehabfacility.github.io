      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.

Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.
