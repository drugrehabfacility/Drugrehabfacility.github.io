      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.
