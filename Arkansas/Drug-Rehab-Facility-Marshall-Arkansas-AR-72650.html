      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight.
