      They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction.
