      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. 
      From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs.

      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.
