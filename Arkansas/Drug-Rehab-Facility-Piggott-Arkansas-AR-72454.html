      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
