      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience.

      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge.
