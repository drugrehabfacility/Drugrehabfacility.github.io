      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.

      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances.
