      A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008. Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
