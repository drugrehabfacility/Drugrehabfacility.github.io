      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. When the person admits to heroin detox, they should accept that they need to stay inside the center until the moment that they recover. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided.
