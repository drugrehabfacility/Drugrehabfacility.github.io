      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. 
      One of the most common drug addictions that Drug Detox Centers Cincinnati area sees is heroin addiction. People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored.
