      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.
