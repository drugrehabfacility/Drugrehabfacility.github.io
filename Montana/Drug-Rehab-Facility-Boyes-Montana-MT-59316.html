      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.

      Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
