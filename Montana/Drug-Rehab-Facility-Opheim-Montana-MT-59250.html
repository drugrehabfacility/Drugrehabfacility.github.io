      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs.

      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients.

      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment.

      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.
