      Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery.
