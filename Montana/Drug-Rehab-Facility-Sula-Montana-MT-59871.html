      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming.

      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them.
