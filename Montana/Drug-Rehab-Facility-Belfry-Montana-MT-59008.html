      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization.
