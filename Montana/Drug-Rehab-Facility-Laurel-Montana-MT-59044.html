    <p>
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.
