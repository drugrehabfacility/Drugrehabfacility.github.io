      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure.
