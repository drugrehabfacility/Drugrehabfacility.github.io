      An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures.
