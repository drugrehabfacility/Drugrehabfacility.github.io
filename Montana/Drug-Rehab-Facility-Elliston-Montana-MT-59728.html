      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. By analyzing this information, we give an answer with the treatment plan and cost of medical services that would be appropriate for that case. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy.
