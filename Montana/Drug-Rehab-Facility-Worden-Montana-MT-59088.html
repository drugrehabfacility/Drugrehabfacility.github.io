      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.
