      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems.

      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.
