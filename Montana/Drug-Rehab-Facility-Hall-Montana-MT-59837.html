      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse.
