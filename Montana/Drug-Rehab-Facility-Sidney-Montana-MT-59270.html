      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.

      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.
