      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse.

      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol.
