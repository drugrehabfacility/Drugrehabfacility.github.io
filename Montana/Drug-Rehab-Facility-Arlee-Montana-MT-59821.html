      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. Give us a call and start the recovery process today.  1-800-819-9973 Rapid Detox Drug and Alcohol Detoxification has long been accepted as an essential, first step towards recovery from addiction. 
      Alcoholics Anonymous isn't an organization you can see a few occasions and consider yourself "cured." Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is among the very best treatment choices for a recovering alcoholic. An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others.
