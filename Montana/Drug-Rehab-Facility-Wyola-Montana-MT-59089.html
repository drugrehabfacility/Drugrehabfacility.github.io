      Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications.Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process.
