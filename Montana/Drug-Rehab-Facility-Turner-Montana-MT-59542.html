      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.
