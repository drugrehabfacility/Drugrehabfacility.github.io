      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use.

      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. Each one of these facilities has their own treatment style and philosophy. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.
