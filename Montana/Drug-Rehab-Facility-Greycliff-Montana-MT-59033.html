      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms – Unknown to some alcohol produces many withdrawal effects including delirium tremens (uncontrolled shaking), seizures, depression, anxiety, stomach aches, vomiting, restlessness and headaches. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober.
