      Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.

      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction.
