      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem.
