      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.ILLINOIS View the Best Rehabs in Illinois See All Results > Questions?

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009.
