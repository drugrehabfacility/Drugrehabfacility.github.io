      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      Benzodiazepine Rehab & Detox, Pharmaceutical & Alcohol Rehab Difficulty withdrawing from harmful drugs or alcohol is the major barrier to happiness and health and getting yourself back. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers.

      If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing.
