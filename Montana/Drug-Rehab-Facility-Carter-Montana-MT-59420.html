      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience.
