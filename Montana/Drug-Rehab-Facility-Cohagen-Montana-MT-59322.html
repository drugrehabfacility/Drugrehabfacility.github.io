      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.Find an Amphetamine Addiction Treatment Center If you’re considering amphetamine addiction treatment but don’t know where to look, we can help. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance. 
      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts.Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol.

      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.
