      Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. RehabCenter.net Offers Free Information on Ohio’s Residential Rehab Programs A drug or alcohol dependency can seriously damage your health and destroy your life. 
      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism.
