      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse.
