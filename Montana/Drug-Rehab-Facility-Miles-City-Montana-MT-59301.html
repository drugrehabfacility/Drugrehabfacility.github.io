      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
