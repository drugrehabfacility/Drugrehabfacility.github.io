      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.
