      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. If you are dealing with an addiction, don't wait another day. [...If the patient lives in serbia, we provide the possibility of consultation where one will come to us and get free medical examination. 
      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant.
