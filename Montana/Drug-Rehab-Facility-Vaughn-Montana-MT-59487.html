      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.
