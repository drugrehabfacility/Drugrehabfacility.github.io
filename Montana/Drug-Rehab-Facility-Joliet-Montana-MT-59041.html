      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.

      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat.

      You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away.
