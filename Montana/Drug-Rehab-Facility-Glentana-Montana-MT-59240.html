      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Our experts in drug detox in Howell often see how lack of knowledge is able to get in the way when people struggle with addiction.  It’s important to learn how addiction happens, and how drug detox works. 
      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. 
      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people.

      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well.
