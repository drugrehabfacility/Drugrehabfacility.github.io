      5 Signs Inpatient Drug Detox is Right for You CALL FOR HELP! 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Search our directory or call 800-483-2193 to speak with a caring treatment specialist today! 
      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run.

      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine.
