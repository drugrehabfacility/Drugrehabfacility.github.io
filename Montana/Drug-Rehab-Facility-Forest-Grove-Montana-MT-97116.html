      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
