      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need. 
      We offer a network of solutions for those struggling with alcohol and drug abuse. You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.

      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
