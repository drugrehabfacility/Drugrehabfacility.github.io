      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal.Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
