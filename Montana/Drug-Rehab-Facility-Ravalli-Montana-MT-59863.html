      Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.

      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Of course, if they are going to crave for more heroin, it is the time that they will have the particular revulsion signs and symptoms.
