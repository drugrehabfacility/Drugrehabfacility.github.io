      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused.
