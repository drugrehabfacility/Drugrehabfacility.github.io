      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. 
      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances.
