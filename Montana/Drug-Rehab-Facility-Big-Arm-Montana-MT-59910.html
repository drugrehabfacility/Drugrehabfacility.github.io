      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      I am happy to be here and I know anyone that comes here will be happy too.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean.
