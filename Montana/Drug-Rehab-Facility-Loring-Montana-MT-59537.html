      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). When you search for a drug detox facilities near me it will begin your road to recovery.  The first thing a Miami drug detox does for you is separate you from your normal environment where drugs or alcohol are readily available or easy to acquire. 
      Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason.
