      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction.
