      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts.You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available.
