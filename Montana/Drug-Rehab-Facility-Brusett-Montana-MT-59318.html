      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience.

      This is not something you can do safely on your own. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. 
      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.

      Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.
