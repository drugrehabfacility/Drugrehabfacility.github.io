      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance.
