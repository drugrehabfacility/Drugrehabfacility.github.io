      Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program.
