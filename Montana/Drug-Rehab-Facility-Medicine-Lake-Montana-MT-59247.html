      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery.
