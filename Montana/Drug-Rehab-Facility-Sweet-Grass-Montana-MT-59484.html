      There are many Illinois Detox Centers Services able to help people suffering from substance abuse. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.
