      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction.

      Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.
