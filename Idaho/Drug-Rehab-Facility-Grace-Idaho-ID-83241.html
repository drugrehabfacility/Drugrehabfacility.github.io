      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path.

      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
