      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Need help finding an inpatient drug detox center? Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. 
      Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
