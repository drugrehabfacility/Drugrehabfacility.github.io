      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.
