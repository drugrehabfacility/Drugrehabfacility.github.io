      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox.
