      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. In other instances Alanon members might be uncomfortable since they've told lies especially to cover up for the alcoholic or to stop conflict. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
