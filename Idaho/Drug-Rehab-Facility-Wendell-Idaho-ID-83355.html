      A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008. This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature. 
      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      They will admit an opiate user, but with the understanding that they will have to “tough out” the uncomfortable withdrawal. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming.

      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
