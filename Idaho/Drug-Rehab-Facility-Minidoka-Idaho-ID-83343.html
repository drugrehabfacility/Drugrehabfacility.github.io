      Drug Detox Centers that are Comfortable and Relaxing Our drug detox counselors are here to serve you or your loved one today. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts.
