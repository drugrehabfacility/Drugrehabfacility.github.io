      Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. 
      Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment.
