      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
