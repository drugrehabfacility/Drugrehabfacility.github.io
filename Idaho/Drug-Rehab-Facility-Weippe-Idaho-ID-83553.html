      We can help you determine what option is best for you. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.

      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.
