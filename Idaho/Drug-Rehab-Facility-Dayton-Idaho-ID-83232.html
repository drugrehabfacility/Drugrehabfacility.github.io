      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.

      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility.
