      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
