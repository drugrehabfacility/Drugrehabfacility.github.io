      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers.
