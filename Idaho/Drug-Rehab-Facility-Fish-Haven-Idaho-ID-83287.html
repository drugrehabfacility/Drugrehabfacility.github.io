      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process. 
      The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.

      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. Red Rock Canyon is a great place to go hiking and climbing or you can head out to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam for tours and boating. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
