      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. There are currently about three hundred drug treatment centers in Massachusetts.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Massachusetts. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions.

      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures.
