      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with.
