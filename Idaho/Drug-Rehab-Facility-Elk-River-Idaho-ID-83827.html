      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. You’re in good hands with our compassionate, expertly trained medical teams. 
      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy.
