      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.
