      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
