      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. In the each situation I have learned "from you" to look at the positive, in everything however small it may seem. 
      Services between different medical detox centers can be very great. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history.
