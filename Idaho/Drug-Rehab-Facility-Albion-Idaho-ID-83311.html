      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids.

      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping.
