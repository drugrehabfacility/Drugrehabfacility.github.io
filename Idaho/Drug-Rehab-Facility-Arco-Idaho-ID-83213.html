      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Withdrawal symptoms experienced by abusers and addicts can begin to experience withdraw symptoms as early as a day after the use has stopped. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort.
