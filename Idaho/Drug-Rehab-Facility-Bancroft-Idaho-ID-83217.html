      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
