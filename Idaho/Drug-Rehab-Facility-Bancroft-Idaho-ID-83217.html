      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery.
