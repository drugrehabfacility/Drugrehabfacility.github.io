      For most people, alcohol is filtered out of their system in roughly seven to 10 days. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal.
