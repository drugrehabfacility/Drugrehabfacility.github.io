      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks.
