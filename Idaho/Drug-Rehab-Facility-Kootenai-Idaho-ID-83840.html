    <p>
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks. In the various Hartford drug detox centers, there are programs available for drug detoxification in inpatient as well as outpatient environments. 
      However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.

      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs.

      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
