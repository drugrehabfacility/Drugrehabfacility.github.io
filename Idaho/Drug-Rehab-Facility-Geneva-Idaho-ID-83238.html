      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
