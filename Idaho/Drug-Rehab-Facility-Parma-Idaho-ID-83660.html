      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. 
      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

      Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process.
