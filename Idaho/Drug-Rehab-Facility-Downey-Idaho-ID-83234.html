      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse.

The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
