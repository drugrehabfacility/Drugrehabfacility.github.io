      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. 
      Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.

      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been.
