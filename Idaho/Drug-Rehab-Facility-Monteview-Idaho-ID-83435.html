      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control.

      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process.
