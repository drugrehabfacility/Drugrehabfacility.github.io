      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it.
