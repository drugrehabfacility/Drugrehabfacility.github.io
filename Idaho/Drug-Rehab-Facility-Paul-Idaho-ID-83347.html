We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
    </p>
    <p>
      If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment? 
      G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 - OR - Request a Callback G&G Holistic Addiction Treatment Program is a nationally recognized drug and alcohol rehab and treatment center with a comprehensive and integrated Mind-Body-Spirit approach to the treatment of addictions and co-occurring disorders. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.

      These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. Many different Christian treatment methods exist ranging from twelve step methods to other faith-centered approaches to treatment. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens.Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
