Rapid Detox Versus Traditional Detox Free Detox Centers Some people just can’t afford any type of treatment for their addiction. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable.
