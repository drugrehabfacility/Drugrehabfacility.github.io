      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.

      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs.
