      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety.
