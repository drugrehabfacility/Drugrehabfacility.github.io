      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV.
