      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.

      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction.
