      Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically.
