      The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland.

      Rapid Drug Detox Center benchmarks the quality of care to ensure it is higher than the national standard and the best in the nation. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
