      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence.
