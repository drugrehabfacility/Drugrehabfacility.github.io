      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 - OR - Request a Callback G&G Holistic Addiction Treatment Program is a nationally recognized drug and alcohol rehab and treatment center with a comprehensive and integrated Mind-Body-Spirit approach to the treatment of addictions and co-occurring disorders. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed.
