      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result.Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.

      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable.
