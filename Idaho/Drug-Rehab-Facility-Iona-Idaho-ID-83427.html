      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.

      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
