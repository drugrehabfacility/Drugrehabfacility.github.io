      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox.

But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach.
