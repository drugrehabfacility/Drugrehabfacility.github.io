      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. Neurofeedback – During drug detox, many clients find that neurofeedback helps to reduce pain, anxiety and drug cravings, improve concentration, and restore sleep. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
