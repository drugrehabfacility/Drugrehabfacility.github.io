      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).

      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. We will then go over the best plan as to get you enrolled in that facility. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience. Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change.
