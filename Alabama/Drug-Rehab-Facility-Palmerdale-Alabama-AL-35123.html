      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life.

Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
