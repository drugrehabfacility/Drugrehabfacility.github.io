      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs.

      Our programs for drug withdrawal in Howell offers the best possible care to all of our patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment.If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery.
