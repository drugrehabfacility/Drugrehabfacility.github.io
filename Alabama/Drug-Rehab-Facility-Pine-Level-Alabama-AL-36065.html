      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.
