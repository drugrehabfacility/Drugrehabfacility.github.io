      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care.

      We have access to the most efficient drug and alcohol Detox centers in the country. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well.

      Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time.
