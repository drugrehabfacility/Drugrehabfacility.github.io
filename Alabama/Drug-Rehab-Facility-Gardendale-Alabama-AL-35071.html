      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.

      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.
