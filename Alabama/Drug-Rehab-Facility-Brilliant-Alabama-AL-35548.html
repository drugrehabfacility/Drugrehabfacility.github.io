      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.

      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio.

      Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
