      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      Call now to find a program that meets your recovery needs. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects.
