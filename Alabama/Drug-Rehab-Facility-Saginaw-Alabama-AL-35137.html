      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Get them the help they need so they can begin their journey to recovery today. Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      You may not feel ready to give up drugs and alcohol.

      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      There are currently about three hundred drug treatment centers in Massachusetts.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Massachusetts. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.
