      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. 
      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction.Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.

      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
