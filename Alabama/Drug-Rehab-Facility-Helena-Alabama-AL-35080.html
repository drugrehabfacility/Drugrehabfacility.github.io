      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. 
      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. They will admit an opiate user, but with the understanding that they will have to “tough out” the uncomfortable withdrawal. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.

      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism.
