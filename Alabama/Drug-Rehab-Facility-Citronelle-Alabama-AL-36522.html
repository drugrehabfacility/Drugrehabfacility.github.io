      Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Neurofeedback – During drug detox, many clients find that neurofeedback helps to reduce pain, anxiety and drug cravings, improve concentration, and restore sleep. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      A detox center providing the highest level of care will staff medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment providers that are all available to clients.
