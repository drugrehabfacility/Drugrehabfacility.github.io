      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober.
