      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      Ohio drug detox centers provide both outpatients as well as inpatients rehab programs. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.
