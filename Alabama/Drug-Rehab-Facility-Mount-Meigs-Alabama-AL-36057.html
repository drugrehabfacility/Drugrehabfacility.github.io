      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 5 Signs Inpatient Drug Detox is Right for You CALL FOR HELP! 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts.
