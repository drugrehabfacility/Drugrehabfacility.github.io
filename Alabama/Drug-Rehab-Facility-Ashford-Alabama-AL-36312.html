      The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. 
      If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.
