      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Compare the results that are listed and if possible, have a personal chat with the ones you like best. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation.
