      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency.Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
