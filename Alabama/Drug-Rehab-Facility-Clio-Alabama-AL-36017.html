      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program. 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.
