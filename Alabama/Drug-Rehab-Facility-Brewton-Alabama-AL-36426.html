Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility.

      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.

      As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first.Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.

      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program.
