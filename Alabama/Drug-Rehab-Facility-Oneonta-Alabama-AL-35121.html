      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. Decide to interact with others in the "living room" around the fireplace, or in front of one of many large, flat screen digital TVs packed with premium programming. 
      Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
