      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps.

      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
