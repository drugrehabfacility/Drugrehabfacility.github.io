      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. Some of these dangers can include seizures and even death. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body.
