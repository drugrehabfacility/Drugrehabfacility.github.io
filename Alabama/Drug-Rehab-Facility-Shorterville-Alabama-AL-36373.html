      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself.

From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers.

      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs.
