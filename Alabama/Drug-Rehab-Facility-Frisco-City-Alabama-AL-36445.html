      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      Correct healthy detox & withdrawal programs ensures that detox is wonderfully successful and healthy. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit.
