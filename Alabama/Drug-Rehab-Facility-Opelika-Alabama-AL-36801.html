      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      You're certain that a meeting isn't on Earth which may help you. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms.

A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects.
