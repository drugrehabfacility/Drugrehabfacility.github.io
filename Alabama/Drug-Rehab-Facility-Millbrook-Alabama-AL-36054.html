      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. It is completely your responsibility to seek out the help. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance.

      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.

Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.
