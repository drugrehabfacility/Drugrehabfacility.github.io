      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Get them the help they need so they can begin their journey to recovery today. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.
