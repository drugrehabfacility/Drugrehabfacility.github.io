      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. 
      When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens.

      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.

      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
