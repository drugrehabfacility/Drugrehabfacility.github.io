      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. More Testimonials Here Need Help With Drugs or Alcohol? 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.

      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful.

      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it.

      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.

      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.
