      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room.
