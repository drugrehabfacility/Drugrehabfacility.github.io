      Correct healthy detox & withdrawal programs ensures that detox is wonderfully successful and healthy. 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever!
