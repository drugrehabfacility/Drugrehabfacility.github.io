      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used.

      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. Make the call and get him or her the help needed today. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.
