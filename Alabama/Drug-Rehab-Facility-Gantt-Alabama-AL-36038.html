      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. 
      Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. 
      From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers.
