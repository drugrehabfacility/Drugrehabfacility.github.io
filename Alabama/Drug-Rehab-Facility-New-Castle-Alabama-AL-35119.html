      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.
