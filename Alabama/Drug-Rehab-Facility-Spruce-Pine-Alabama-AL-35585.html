      Recovery Advice When Money Is Scarce Living on a limited income is challenging enough; having to deal with recovery from a drug or alcohol addiction on a limited income is even more so. Respectfully, STARNER JONES, MD 876566 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 8 months Ago I want to share the experience that my husband, 7 year old autistic sister and I had today at the Chili’s location in Midvale, UT. 
      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be?
