      Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Each one of these facilities has their own treatment style and philosophy.

      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.
