      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.

      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs.

      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis.
