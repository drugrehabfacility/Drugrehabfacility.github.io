      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. 
      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal.
