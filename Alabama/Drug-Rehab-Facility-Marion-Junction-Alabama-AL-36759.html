      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction.
