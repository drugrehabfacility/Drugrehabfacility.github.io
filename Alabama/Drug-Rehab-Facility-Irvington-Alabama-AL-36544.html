      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.

The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body.
