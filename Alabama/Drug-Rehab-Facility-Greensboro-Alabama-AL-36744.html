      Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. 
      The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. There are many different types of detox centers, including Medical detox facilities Alcohol detox facilities Drug detox facilities Rapid detox facilities Holistic detox facilities Inpatient detox facilities Outpatient detox facilities Depending on your needs and your comfort level with certain types of treatment, one of these programs may be the best option for your needs. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.

      Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      They will admit an opiate user, but with the understanding that they will have to “tough out” the uncomfortable withdrawal. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs.
