      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. 
      Personal events, trauma and the environment does affect drug use.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
