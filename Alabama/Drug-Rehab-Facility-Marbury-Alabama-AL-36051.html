      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. We also help you to establish different behaviors that will lead you to a life that is drug free, permanently. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling.
