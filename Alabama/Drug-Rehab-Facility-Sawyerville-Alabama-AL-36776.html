      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. In the United States, it's the most prevalent of the addictions of the nation. 
      Preferred Family Healthcare, Quincy (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Otherwise known as “Recovery Resources,” the Quincy facility merged with Preferred Family Healthcare in July 2014. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.

      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Glenbeigh, Niles (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today An affiliate of Cleveland Clinic, Glenbeigh is an alcohol and drug addiction treatment center staffed by licensed independent social workers, physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, certified chemical dependency counselors and clergy. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day.
