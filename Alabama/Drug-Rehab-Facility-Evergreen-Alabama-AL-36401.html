      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path.
