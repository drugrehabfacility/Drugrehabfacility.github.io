      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Simply put, the treatment program uses different disciplines with planning and purpose.

      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs.

      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete.
