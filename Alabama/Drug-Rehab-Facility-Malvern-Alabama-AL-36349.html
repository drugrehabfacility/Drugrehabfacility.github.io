      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility.
