      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people.
