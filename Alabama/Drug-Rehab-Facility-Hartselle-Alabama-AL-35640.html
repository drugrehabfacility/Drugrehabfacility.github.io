      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      My next interest is to save you unnecessary rehab expenses wherever possible.

      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.

      While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 
      The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
