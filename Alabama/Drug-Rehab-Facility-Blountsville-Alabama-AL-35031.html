      Many people find themselves from hooked on this kind of substances. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal.
