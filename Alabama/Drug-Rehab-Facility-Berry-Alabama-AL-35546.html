      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. 
      With a big smile and the huge love I've always had for you, I just want to say, I love you ... my darling daughter.
