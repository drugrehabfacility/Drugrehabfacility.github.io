      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      The information is free, the call is free and so is the referral.
