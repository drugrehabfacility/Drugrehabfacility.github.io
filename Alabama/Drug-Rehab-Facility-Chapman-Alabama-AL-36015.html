      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.
