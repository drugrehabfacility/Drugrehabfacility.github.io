      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts.

      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.
