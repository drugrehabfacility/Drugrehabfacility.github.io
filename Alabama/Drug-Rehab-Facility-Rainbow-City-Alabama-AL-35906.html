      In effect, someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has come to rely on the drug’s effects to cope with everyday life. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature.

On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living.
