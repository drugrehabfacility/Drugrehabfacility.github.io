      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role.
