      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.
