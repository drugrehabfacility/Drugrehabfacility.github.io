      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process.Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. 
      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      There are many Illinois Detox Centers Services able to help people suffering from substance abuse.The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.
