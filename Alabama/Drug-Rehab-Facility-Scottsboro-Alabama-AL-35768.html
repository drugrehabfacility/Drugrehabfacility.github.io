      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps?
