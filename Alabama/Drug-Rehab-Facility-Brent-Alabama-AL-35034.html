      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. The goal of drug detox is minimize and manage drug or alcohol withdrawal symptoms in a medically safe setting. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
