      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. 
      Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.
