      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer.
