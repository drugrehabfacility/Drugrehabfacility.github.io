      Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. Our recommended integrative detox centers deliver more effective and sympathetic levels of care than Sierra Tucson, the Meadows or McLean Hospital to name a few. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.
