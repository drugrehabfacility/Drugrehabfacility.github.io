    <p>
      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).
