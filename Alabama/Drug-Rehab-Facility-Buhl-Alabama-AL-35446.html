      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      Ohio Drug & Alcohol Rehab While no single treatment works for every person, a unique process will be created for you. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death.
