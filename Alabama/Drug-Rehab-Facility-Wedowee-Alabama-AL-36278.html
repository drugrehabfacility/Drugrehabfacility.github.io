      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      4) Methadone Clinic in Connecticut: A methadone clinic is not actually a “detox”, although methadone is sometimes used to help someone to stop using opiates. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
