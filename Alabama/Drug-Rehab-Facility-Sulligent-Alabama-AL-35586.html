      We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better.
