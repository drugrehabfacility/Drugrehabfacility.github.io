      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox.

      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment.
