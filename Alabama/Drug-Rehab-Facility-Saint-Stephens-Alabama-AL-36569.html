      In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.
