      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. 
      If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice.

      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
