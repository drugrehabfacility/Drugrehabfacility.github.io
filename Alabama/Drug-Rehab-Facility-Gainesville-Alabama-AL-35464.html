      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. 
      Multi-dimensional family therapy: is specially meant to help addicts recover through the support of their families.
