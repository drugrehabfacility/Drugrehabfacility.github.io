      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 24-Hour Care At our addiction treatment center, individuals receive 24-hour medical care that which includes psychiatric and nursing care as well as personalized wellness and medication plans. 
      Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms.

      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.

It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety.

      Find an Amphetamine Addiction Treatment Center As addiction affects different people in different ways, there’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach to drug treatment.Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.
