      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      Whether you’re having nausea or you feel like you need someone to speak with, our professionals will be there for you.
