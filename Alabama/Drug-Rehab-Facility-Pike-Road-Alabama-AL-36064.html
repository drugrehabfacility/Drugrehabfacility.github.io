      Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. 
      During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Internet gives you ample opportunities to compare prices and location of the various centers in and around Chicago; make the most of the opportunity to choose a program. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.
