      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else.
