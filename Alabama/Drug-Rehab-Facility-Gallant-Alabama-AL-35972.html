      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used.
