      These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol. 
      The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine. 
      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means.
