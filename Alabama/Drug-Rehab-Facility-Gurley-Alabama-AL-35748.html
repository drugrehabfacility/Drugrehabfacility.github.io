      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
