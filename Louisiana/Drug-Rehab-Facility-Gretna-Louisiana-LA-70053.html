      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. 
      Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision.
