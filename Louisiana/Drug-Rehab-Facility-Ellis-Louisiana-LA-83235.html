      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts.

      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery.

      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role.
