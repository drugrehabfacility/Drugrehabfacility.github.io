      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery! 
      They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms.
