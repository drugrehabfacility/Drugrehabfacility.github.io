      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Once you have identified what you exactly want out of a detox program, you can take help of the internet to locate the various drug detox centers in Hartford. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol.

      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. We then came up with a final ranking, and filtered out the very best for this list.
