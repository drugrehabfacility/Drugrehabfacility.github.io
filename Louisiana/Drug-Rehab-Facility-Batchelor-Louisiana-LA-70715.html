      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.

      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers.
