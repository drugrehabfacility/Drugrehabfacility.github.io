      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. This is not something you can do safely on your own.

      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it.Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
