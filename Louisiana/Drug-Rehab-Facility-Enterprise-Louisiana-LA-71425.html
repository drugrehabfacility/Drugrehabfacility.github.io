      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program.
