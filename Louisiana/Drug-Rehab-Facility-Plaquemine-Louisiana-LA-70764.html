      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. It is completely your responsibility to seek out the help.
