      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms During Detox - Drug Detox Centers Different drugs have different withdrawal symptoms during detox. Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms.

Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl?
