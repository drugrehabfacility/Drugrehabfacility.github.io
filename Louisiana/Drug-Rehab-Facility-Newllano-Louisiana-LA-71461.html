      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay.
