      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab.
