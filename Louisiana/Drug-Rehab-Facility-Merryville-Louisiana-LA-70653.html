      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine.
