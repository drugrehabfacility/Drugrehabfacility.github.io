      For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. 
      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.
