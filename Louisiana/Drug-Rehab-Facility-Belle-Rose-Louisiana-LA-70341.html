      Alcoholics Anonymous isn't an organization you can see a few occasions and consider yourself "cured." Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is among the very best treatment choices for a recovering alcoholic.

      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts.
