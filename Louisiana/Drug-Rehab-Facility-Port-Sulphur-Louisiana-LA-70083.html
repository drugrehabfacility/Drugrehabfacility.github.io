      Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. Early on in the treatment of addiction, neurofeedback may help you establish healthier patterns of brain activity. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.
