The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.

      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against.

After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.
