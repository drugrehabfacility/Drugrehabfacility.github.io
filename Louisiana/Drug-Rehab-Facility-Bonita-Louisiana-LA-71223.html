      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
