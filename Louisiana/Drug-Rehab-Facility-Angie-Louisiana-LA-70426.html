      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help.
