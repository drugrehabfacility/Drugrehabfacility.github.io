      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time.
