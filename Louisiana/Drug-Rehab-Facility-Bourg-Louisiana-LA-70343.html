      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Call us today and take the first step towards recovery. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.
