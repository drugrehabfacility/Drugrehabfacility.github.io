    <p>
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. 
      3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs. For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope.
