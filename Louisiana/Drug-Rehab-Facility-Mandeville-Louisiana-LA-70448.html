    <p>
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. She came back a minute later and said she showed everyone in the back kitchen area too, and that it made them all laugh and smile. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. For more information on this facility go to www.zepfcenter.org/ 5.
