      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting.
