      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Medications that Help Addiction treatment has come a long way, and inpatient drug detox centers have a variety of different medications that they can use to help people deal with withdrawal. 
      Physical activities: Hiking, swimming, gym workouts and sports are all helpful tools in recovery. both as a distraction and way of making you healthier and happier. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
