      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. 
      Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.

      Connecticut, CT offers some of the best detoxification centers and facilities for drug and alcohol withdrawal from substance abuse.
