      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
