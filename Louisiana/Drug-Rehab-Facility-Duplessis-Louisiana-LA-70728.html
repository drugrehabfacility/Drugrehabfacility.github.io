      A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. We then came up with a final ranking, and filtered out the very best for this list. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.

Outpatient detoxification as safe and effective as inpatient detoxification for those with mild withdrawal benefits those with positive, supportive family circumstances or job situations can continue to work and maintain day-to-day activities with fewer disruptions greater social support opportunities than inpatient increased risk of relapse resulting due to easy access of drugs/alcohol less expensive less time consuming not appropriate for all patients; requires assessment retain greater freedom suitable for those with high motivation to complete detox Inpatient detoxification 24/7 medical support cases of heavy alcohol/drug dependence or chronic use cases of previous complications or intense symptoms of withdrawal higher cost may encourage unnecessary dependence on hospital staff more likely to complete detoxification process than outpatient suitable for suicidal or homicidal patients suitable for those at risk of potentially life-threatening complications of withdrawal suitable for those in adverse or disruptive family or job situations suitable for those not able to travel daily to a treatment facility suitable for those with severe or medically complicated withdrawal Being anxious about entering a detox treatment program is natural.
