      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety.

But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?

      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery.
