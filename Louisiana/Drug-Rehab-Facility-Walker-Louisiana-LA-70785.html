      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using.

      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Although integrative medicine is easily the most popular and effective treatment strategy for any health problem, currently there are only a few integrative medical detox centers in North America. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort.Once this information is established, if the state deems that the client cannot pay, they may provide free treatment on various levels through specific types of clinics or treatment centers. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.

Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary.
