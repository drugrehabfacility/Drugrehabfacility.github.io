      This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more.
