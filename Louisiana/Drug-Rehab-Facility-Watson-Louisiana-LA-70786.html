      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
