      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
