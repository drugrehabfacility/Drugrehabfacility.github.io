President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab.
