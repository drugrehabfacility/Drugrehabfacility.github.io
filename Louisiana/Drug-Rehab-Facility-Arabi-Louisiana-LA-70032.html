      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.

      SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7.
