      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      Our addiction specialists can assess your recovery needs and help you get the addiction treatment that provides the best chance for your long-term recovery.Easy drug detox is a successful method of drug detoxification.
