      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol.

      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete.If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.
