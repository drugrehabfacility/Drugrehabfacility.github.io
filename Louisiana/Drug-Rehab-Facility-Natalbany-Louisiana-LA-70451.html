      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
