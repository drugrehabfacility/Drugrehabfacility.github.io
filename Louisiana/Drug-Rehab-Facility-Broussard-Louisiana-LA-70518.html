      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.
