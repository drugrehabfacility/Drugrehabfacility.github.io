      We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use.

For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused.
