      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Perhaps it could be discussed as a loan that the individual can work to pay back over time. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse.
