State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey.
