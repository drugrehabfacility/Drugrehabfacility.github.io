      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.Home Detox Centers Detox Centers Detox centers provide effective detoxification programs and methods to assist those who suffer from drug or alcohol addiction in finding the strength to make their way through the withdrawal symptoms and come out on top of addiction.
