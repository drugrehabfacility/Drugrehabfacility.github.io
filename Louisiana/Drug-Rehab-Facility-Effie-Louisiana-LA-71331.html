      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs? 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms.
