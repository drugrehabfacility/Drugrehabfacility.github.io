      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
