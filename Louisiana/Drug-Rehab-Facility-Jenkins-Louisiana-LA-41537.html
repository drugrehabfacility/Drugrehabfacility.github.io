      If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program.

      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. 
      A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source.
