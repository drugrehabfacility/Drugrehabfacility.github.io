      Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. 
      Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.

      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now.
