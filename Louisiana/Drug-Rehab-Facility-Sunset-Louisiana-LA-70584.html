      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. Don’t fall victim to this statistic, call 800-483-2193 today and we’ll connect you with a detox specialist that can answer your questions and help you find a center that’s able to assist in your recovery process.

      Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      Ohio drug detox centers provide both outpatients as well as inpatients rehab programs.
