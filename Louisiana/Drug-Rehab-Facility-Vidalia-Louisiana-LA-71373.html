      RDD Center admits patients to our licensed surgical facility for the detoxification procedure to guarantee the proper monitoring and medical care. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers.
