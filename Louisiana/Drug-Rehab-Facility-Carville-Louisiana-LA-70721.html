In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem.

      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have.Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again.

      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.

      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals.
