      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. Search our directory or call 800-483-2193 to speak with a caring treatment specialist today!

      Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids.
