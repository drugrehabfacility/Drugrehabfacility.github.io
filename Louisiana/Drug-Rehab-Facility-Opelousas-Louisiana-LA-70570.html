      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring.
