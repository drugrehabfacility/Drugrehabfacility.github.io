      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
