      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse.

      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals.
