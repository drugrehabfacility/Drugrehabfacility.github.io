      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. We specialise in helping you find inpatient and outpatient detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT with treatment programs for substance abuse. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.

      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. 
      You may not know what’s next for you after detox.

      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
