      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
