Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
