      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
