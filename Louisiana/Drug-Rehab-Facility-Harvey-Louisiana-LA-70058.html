      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
