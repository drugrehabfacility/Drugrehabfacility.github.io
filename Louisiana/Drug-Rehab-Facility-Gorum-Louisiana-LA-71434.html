      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.
