      If you have any queries or concerns about our detox process, call us now at (201) 549-8050. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Rather, we offer an educational cognitive behavioral education program that helps you identify the habits that led you to choose drugs and help you create different habits and a more fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle. Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions. The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.
