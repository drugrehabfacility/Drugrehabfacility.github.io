      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it.
