      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. 
      We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life.
