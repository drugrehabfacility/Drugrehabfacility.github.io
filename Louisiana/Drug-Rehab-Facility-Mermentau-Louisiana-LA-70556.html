      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case.
