      The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment.

      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
