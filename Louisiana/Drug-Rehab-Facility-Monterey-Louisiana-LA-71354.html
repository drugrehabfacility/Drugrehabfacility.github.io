      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal.
