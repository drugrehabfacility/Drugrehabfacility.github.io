      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. Some of these drug rehab centers in Ohio are situated on 10-15 acres of land and offer long-term treatment programs, and some offer programs lasting less than a month. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
