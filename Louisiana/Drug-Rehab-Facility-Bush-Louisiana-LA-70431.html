      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future.

      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. In the each situation I have learned "from you" to look at the positive, in everything however small it may seem. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.

We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life.

      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. Ohio is one of the five national states with the highest rate of overdose deaths. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. 
      Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs? 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications? 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Illinois & Drug Abuse Alcoholism is a sneaky illness.
