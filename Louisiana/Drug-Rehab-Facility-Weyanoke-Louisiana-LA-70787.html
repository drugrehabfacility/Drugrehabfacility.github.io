      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.

      You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track. As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided.
