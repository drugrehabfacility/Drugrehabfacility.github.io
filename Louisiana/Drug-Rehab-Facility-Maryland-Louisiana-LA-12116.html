      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
