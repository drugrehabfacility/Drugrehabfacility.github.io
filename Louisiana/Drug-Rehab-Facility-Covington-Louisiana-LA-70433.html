      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.DETOX FACILITIES Though many choose to detox through a general hospital, United Drug Rehab Group clients go through an emotionally stronger and more stable backdrop for their recovery. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.
