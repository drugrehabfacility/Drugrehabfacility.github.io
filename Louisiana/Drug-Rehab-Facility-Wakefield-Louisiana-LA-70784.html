      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so.
