      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways.

      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.

      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery.
