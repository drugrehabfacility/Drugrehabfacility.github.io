      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      In the various drug detoxification programs and alcohol detox treatments, the body is purged of the poisons accumulated in the body as a consequence of addiction. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.
