      As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question.
