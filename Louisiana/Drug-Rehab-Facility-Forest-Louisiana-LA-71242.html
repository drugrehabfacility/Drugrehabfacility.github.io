Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery.
