      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Contact us today to find the right program for you or a loved one.
