      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role.It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.

      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis.
