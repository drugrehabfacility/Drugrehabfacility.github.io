      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      Specific plans may have different coverage levels, so it’s a good idea to check the specific policy or talk to the insurance provider. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic.
