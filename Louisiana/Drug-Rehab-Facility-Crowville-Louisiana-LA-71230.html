      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, treatment needs to consider include: Impact amphetamine abuse has on your day-to-day life Any health problems resulting from drug use Any mental or emotional problems resulting from drug use How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
