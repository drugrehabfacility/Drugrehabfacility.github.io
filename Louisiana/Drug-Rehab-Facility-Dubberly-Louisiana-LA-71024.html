      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. 
      The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient.

      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Successful Detox: This means you'll get the most care from integrative holistic and medical detox providers who specialize in natural care methods. 
      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients.
