      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse.
