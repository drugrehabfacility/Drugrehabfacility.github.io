      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves. With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
