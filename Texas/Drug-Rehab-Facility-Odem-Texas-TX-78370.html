      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative. 
      Please tell Kathy she is great, and made a big difference for me.
