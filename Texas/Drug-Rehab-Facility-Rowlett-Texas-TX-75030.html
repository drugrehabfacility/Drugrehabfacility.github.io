      When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. 
      Getting Help in Illinois Do not feel alone in your fight against your addiction. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.

      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.
