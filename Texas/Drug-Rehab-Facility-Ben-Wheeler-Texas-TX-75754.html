      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs.
