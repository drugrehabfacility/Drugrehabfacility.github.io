      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
