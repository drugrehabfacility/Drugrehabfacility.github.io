      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. 
      Physical dependence is one of the most difficult parts of any addiction to overcome but with the help of detox centers and the specialized programs, medications, therapists and medical interventionist who provide care at these facilities, those who suffer from even the strongest of addictions can get past the physical dependence that keeps them using drugs or alcohol and prepare for psychological recovery. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins.
