      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. 
      This allows someone to not so much focus on what is missing in their detox facility in Washington but more so on the next steps needed for them to get sober and stay sober after their physical detox.
