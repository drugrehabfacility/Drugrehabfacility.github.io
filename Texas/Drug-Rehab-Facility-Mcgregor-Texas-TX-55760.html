      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. 
      Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.

      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.

      A blockagge that does not allow the patient the possibility to return to drugs at all so patient is not interested in drugs anymore. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone.

      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help.As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries.
