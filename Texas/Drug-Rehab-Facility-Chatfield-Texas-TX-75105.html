      New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery. 
      These centers also attain to excellent standards of integrated detox and rehab services for their clients. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient.
