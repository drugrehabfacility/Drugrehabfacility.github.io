      Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 - OR - Request a Callback Palm Partners Treatment Center is one of the most successful drug rehab centers in the country at a fraction of the price of other addiction treatment centers. To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism.
