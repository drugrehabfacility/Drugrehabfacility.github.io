      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.

      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery.Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. There are many people going through what you are right now. 
      You should have the actual desire to be back to the strong person you know you deserve to be, and all you have to do is get over this ugly step and there will be such an amazing future for you, something you can’t even imagine. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort.Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. 
      In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox.

      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step!

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery.
