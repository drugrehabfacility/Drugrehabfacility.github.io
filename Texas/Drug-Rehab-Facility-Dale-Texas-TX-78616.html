      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. 
      Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      For medical detox help, contact Drug Rehab Centers Putnam at (860) 207-8362. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
