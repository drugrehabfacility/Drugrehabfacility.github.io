      Recovery Advice When Money Is Scarce Living on a limited income is challenging enough; having to deal with recovery from a drug or alcohol addiction on a limited income is even more so. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.

      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. 
      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Counseling Individual and group counseling is used to identify the underlying issues that led to a client’s addiction. 
      Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace.
