      Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.

      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use.
