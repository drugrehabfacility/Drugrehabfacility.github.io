      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse.

      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.

      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety.
