      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. 
      Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. Our in-house program allows the medical team to begin working to improve your life in a drug-free environment. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin.
