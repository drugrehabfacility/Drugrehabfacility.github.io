      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      You may not know what’s next for you after detox. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings.
