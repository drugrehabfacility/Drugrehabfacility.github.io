      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. 
      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
