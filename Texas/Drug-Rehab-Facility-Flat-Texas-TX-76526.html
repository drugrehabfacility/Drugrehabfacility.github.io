      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. It also gives him a chance to discuss privately those items which he may not be prepared to discuss in front of a group.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
