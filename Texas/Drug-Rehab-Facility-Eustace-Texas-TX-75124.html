      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. This makes create seizures, stroke or may cause death. 
      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.

In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.
