      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms.
