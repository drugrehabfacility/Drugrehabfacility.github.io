      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.

      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems.Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate.
