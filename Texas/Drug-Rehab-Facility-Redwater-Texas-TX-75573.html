      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. With so much contrast and such a tourist-driven city at the state’s core, it comes as no surprise that people in the Nevada area do have their fair share (and sometime more than their fair share) of challenges and struggles. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.
