      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Specific plans may have different coverage levels, so it’s a good idea to check the specific policy or talk to the insurance provider. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
