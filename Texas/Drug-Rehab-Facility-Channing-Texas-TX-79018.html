      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Drug Detox Drug detoxification or drug detox is used to reduce primarily the withdrawal symptoms in an individual addicted to drugs. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances.

      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities.
