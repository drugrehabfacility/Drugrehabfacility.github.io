      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. 
      Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.At the Angels of Victory drug detox facilities, we have over 30 years of experience treating drug addictions in people of all ages and races. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.
