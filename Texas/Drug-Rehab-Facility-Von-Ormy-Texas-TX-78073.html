      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there.
