      Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. Need help finding an inpatient drug detox center? 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
