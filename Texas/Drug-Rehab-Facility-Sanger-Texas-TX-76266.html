      As a person begins to feel better, they can begin to take a more active part in the therapy part of rehab. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience.
