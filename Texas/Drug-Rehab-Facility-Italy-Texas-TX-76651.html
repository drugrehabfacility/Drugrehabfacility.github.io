      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.

      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Drug Detox Drug detoxification or drug detox is used to reduce primarily the withdrawal symptoms in an individual addicted to drugs. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.
