      Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs.
