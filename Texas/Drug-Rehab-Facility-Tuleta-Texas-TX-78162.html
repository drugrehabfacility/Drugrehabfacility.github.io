      Though alcohol addiction is prevalent in Maryland, only 11. 
      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. 
      Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
