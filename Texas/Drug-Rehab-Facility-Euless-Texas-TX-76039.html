      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.

      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.
