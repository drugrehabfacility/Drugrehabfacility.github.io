      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
