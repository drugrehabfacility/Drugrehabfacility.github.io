      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using.

      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.

      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term.Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. All others are not considered regardless of media hype.

      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.
