      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year.

If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school.
