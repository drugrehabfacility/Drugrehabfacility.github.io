      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results.
