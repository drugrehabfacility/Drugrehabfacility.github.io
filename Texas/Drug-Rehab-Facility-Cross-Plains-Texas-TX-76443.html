      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

    <p>
      A growing number of drug treatment centers in Massachusetts have services for the hearing impaired. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. 
      If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink.
