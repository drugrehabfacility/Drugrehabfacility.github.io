      Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center. This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.

      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body.
