      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult.For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive.

      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one.
