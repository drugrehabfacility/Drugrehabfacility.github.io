      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. 
      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. 
      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely.
