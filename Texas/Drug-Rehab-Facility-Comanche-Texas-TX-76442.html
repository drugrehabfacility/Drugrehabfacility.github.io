      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction.

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.
