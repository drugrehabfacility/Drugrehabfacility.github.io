    <p>
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. Your browser may also contain add-ons that send automated requests to our search engine. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process.
