      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs.
