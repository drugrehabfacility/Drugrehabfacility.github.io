      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. 
      That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.Home Detox Centers Detox Centers Detox centers provide effective detoxification programs and methods to assist those who suffer from drug or alcohol addiction in finding the strength to make their way through the withdrawal symptoms and come out on top of addiction.
