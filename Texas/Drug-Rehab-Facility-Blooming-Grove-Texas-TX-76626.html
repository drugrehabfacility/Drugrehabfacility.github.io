      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
