      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address. Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time.

      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center.
