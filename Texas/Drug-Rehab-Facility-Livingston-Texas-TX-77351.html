      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Methadone detox centers provide professional medical care to assist those addicted to methadone with their first phase of recovery—detoxification. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s.
