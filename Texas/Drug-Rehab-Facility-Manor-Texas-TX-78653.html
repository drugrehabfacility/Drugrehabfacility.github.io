There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab. You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
