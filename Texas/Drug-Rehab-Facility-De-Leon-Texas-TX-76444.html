      Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.
