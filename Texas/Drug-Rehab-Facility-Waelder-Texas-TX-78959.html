      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.
