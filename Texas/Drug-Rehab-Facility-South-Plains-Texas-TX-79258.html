      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.
