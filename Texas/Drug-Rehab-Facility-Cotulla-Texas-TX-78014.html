      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.
