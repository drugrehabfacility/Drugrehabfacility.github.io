      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare.

      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Some of these drug rehab centers in Ohio are situated on 10-15 acres of land and offer long-term treatment programs, and some offer programs lasting less than a month. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
