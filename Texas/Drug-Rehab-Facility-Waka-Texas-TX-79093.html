      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.DETOX FACILITIES Though many choose to detox through a general hospital, United Drug Rehab Group clients go through an emotionally stronger and more stable backdrop for their recovery. 
      The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      Round-the-Clock Care – You’ll be monitored around the clock by staff that will check vital signs and make sure that you feel comfortable and cared for. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given.
