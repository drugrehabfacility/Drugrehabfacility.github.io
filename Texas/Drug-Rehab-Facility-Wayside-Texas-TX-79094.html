      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. For more information on rehabilitation and the detox process, contact us today.
