      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. 
      Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.

      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need.
