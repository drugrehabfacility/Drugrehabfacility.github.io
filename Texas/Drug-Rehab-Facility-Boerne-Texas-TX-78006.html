      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing.
