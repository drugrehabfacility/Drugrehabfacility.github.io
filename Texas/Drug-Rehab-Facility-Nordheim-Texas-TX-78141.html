      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance.
