      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.

      What are the kinds of treatments found in Chicago drug detox centers? For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.

      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab.
