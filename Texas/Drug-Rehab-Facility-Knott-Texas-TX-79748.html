      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine.

      Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics.
