      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol. 
      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery.
