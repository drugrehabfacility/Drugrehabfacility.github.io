      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision.

      In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. As a person begins to feel better, they can begin to take a more active part in the therapy part of rehab. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
