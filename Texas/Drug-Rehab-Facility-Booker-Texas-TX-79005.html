      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. 
      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification.

      It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs.
