      From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher.

      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
