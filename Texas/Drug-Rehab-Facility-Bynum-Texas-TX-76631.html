      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health. While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. 
      Do you know someone who is looking for a drug and alcohol detox center in Illinois? Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process.

      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well.

      How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications? Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered.Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Our recommended integrative detox centers deliver more effective and sympathetic levels of care than Sierra Tucson, the Meadows or McLean Hospital to name a few. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. 
      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox.During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      Living a Life of Recovery There are millions of people in the world who are struggling with substance use disorders. Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. 
      At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you.
