      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

      Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment?Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      It gets rid of the toxic chemicals that have built up in your system from drug use. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.
