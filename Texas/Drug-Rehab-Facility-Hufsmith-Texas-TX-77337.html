      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Massachusetts; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care.
