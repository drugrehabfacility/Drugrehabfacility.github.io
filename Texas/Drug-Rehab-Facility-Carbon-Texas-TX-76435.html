      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. Call our helpline at 800-483-2193 toll-free to speak with a specialist about your recovery needs. 
      The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them.
