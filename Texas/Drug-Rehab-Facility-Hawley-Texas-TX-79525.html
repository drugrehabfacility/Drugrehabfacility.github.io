      Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening.
