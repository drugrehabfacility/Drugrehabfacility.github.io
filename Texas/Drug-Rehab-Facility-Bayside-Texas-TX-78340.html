      3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs. Correct healthy detox & withdrawal programs ensures that detox is wonderfully successful and healthy. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
