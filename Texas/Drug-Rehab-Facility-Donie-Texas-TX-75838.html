      If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      These scholarships are often offered through private treatment facilities or through organizations concerned with helping those who are struggling with addiction. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program.

      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes.

      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms.

      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
