      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober.
