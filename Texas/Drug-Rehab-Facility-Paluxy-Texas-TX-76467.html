      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. 
      There are priority populations in many state rehab centers. It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle.
