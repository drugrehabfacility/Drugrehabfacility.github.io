      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. 
      Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Center for Addiction Treatment, Cincinnati (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Center for Addiction Treatment is just that–a place where individuals can go to begin or work on their recovery.

      Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      24-Hour Care At our addiction treatment center, individuals receive 24-hour medical care that which includes psychiatric and nursing care as well as personalized wellness and medication plans.
