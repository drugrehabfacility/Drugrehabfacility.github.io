      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Physical dependence is one of the most difficult parts of any addiction to overcome but with the help of detox centers and the specialized programs, medications, therapists and medical interventionist who provide care at these facilities, those who suffer from even the strongest of addictions can get past the physical dependence that keeps them using drugs or alcohol and prepare for psychological recovery. People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system.
