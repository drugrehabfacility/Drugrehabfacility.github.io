      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting.
