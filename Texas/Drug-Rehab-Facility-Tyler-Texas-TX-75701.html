      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.

The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial.

Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly.
