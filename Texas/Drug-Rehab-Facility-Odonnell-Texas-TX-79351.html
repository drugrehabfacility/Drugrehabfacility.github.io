      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
