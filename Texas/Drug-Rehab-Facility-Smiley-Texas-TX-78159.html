      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend.
