      Addiction isn't brought on by the drug, but is brought on by biological and mental vulnerabilities resulting in a variety of kinds of craving." Step one would be to realize the addiction. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment.

      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.
