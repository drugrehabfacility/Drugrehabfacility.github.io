      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.

      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.
