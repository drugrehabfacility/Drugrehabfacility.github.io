      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context.
