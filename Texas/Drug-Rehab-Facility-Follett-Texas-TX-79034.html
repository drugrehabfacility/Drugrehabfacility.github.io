      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs.These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again.
