      In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation.

      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.
