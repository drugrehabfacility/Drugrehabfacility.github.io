      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      If you’re looking for help in Bloomington, Chicago, or Rockford, local Illinois detox centers are found in abundance offering access to the treatment necessary to fuel recovery. For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs.

      They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible.
