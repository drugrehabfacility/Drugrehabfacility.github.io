      Detoxification with the help of Addiction Drug Detox Centers Healthcare Professionals Our healthcare team provides the best care for their guests going through this process. The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. 
      Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse.
