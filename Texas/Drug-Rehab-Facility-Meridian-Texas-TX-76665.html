      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs.
