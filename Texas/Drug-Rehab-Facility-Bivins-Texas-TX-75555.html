      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released.
