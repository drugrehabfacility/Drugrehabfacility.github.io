      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      There are multiple reasons to choose detoxes in MA.
