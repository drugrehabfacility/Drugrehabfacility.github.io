      Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
