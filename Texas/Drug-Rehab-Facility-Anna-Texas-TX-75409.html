      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 - OR - Request a Callback Palm Partners Treatment Center is one of the most successful drug rehab centers in the country at a fraction of the price of other addiction treatment centers. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.
