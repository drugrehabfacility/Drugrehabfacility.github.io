    <p>
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety. 
      The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail.
