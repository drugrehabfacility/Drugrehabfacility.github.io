      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.

Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions.
