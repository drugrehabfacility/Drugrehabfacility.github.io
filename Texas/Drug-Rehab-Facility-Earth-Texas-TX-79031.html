      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
