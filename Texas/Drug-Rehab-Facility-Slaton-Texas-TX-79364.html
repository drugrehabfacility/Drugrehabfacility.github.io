      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.

For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life.
