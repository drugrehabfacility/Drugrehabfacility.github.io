      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. Ohio rehab centers are gold standard centers for addiction treatments. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope.
