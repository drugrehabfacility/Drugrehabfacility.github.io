      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.Drug rehabilitation involves the following types of behavioral therapy; Cognitive behavioral therapy: helps patients know, avoid and bear with situations which may make them return to their addiction habits. 
      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency.
