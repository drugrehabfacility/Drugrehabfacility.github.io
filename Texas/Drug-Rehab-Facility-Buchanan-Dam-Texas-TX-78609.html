      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision.

If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers.
