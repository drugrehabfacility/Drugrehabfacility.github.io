      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.
