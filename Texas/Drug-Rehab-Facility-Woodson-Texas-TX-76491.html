      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
