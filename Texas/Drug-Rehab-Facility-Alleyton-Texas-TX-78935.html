      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. 
      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
