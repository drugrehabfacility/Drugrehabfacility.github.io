      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism.

      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. Recovery Advice When Money Is Scarce Living on a limited income is challenging enough; having to deal with recovery from a drug or alcohol addiction on a limited income is even more so. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
