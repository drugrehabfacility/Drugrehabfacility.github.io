      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
