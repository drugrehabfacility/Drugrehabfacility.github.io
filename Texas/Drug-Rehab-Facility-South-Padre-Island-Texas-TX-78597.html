      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. 
      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal.

    <p>
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      If you are a resident of Illinois and you need to resort to the treatment programs meted out by these organizations, you will find the Chicago detox centers useful.
