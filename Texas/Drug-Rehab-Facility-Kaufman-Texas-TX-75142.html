      Detox </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. 
      Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
