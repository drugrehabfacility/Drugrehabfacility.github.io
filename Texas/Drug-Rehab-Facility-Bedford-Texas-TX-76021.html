    <p>
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming.
