      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown.
