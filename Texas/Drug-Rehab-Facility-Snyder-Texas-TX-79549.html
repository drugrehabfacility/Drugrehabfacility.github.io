      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      When you are considering a facility for drug detox in Connecticut, consider a service that will not only be safe and effective but will also keep you comfortable. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.

      Substance Abuse Treatment 
      Plan </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.
