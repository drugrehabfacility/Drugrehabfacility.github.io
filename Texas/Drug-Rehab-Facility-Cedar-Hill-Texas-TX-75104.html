      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death.
