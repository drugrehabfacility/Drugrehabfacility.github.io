      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Treatment Center Finder will connect you with the right Massachusetts rehab for you or your loved one. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.
