      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school.

      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab.
