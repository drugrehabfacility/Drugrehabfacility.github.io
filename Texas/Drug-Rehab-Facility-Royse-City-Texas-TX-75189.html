      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.

      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common.
