      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 800-483-2193 800-483-2193 Get help for your loved one FEATURED CENTERS Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 Family is Forever.
