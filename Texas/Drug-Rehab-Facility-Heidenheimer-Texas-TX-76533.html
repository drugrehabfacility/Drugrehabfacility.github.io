      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.
