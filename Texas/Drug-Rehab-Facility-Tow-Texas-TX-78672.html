      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.

      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
