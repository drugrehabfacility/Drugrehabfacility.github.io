      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.
