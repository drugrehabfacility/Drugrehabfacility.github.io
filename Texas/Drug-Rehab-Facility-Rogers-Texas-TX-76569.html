      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction.
