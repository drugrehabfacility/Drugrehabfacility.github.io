About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse.
