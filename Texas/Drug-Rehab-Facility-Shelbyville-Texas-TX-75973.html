    <p>
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
