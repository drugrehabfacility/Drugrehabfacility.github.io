      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. We certainly do care about aesthetics and making our guests feel comfortable, but your treatment is our utmost priority. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
