      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. Independent centers may use their own detox facilities when needed. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Call Saint Jude's to find the right detox center Illinois has had an increasing problem with heroin in the past few years. 
      Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab.
