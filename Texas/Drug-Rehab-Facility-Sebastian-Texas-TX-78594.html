    <p>
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount.
