      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs.

      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.

      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. 
      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts. Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision.
