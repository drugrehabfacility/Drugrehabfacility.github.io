      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.
