      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere.
