      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though.
