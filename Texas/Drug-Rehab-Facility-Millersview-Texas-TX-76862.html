      Our advisors are on call to answer any questions on the costs of detox facilities and addiction treatment programs in Connecticut, CT, including coverage for private healthcare and medical insurance. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well.

      Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. 
      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
