      Illinois & Drug Abuse Alcoholism is a sneaky illness. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. 
      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms.If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free.
