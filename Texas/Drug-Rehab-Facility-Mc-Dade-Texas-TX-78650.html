      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
