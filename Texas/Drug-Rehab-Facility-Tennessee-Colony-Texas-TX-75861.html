      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.

      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace.
