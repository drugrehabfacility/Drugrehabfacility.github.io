      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Some of the most common types of detox centers are outlined below: Inpatient Detox Centers These facilities provide the highest level of medical monitoring and supervision of all the other types of detox centers. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.
