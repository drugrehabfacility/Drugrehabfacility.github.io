      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      How can I choose the best among drug detox centers in Chicago? Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.
