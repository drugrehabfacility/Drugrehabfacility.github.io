      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. 
      Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge.
