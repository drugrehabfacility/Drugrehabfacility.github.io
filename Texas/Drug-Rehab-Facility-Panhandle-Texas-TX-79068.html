      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      There are over three hundred drug treatment centers in Maryland.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Maryland.
