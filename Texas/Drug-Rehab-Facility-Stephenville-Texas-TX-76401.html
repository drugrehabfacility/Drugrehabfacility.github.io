      This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.
