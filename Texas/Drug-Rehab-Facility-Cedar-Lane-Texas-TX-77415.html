      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever.

      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. Ohio rehab centers are gold standard centers for addiction treatments. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender.

      Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process.
