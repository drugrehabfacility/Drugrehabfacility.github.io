      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.

When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur.

      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program.

      During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. A good residential treatment facility will be able to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to the needs of each patient. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober.
