      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      I am a critical person and cannot find any issue to complain about.
