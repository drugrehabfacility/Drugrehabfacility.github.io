      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life.

      It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs.
