      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.

      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. If you need alcohol for your body to feel normal, then you likely need help. 
      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center.
