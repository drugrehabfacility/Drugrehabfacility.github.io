      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.
