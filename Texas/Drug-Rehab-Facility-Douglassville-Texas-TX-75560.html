      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be? One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol.
