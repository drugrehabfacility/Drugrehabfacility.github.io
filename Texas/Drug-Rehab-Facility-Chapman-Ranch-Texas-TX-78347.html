      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. 
      The 38-acre property provides an attractive setting for recovery and contemplation, including comfortable and comforting rooms, a full gymnasium, and beautiful natural surroundings. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.

      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.
