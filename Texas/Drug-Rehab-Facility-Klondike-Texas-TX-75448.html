      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      Call 800-483-2193 now to speak with a treatment advisor!  There are many different types of detox centers, each geared around providing a specific type of detoxification, a specific type of treatment or a specific level of care and monitoring. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
