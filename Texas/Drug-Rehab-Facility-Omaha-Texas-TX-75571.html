      Soft Landing Recovery, Oakbrook Terrace (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Soft Landing Recovery has an “at home” outpatient recovery that specializes in helping those with addiction to painkillers and opiates. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts.

      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Getting the right detox withdrawal advice should save you needless worry. 
      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience.
