      What are the kinds of treatments found in Chicago drug detox centers? The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      Round-the-Clock Care – You’ll be monitored around the clock by staff that will check vital signs and make sure that you feel comfortable and cared for. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation.
