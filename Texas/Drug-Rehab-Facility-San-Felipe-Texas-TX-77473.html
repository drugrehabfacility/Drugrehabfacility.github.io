      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. 
      Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future.
