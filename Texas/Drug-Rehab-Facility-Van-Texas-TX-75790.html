      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery.
