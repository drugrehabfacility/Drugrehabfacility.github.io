      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      We offer a network of solutions for those struggling with alcohol and drug abuse. Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. 
      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. With rolling green hills to hike and have picnics on and beautiful lakes and rivers for fishing or kayaking, there’s no shortage of awesome outdoor activities to enjoy.  You can have fun living every day for a long, healthy and happy life. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.
