It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction.
