      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.

In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected.
