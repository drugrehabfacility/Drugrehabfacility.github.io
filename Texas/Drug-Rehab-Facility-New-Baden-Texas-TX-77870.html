      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.
