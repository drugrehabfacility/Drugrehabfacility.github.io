      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being.

      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. We Can Help You Find Drug & Alcohol Rehab Detox Clinics & Centers In Connecticut CT That Accept Your Insurance: Aetna Insurance Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Connecticut CT, Cigna Insurance Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Connecticut CT, Alcohol, Drug Rehab & Detoxification Centers Covered by Medicaid Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehab & Detoxification Centers Covered by Medicare Insurance Connecticut CT, Alcohol, Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Covered by Military Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Treatment Covered by Amerihealth Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Detox & Rehabs Covered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Clinics Covered by Humana Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Clinics Covered by United Behavioral Health Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Treatment Covered by Value Options Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Treatments & Detox Covered by Tricare Insurance Connecticut CT, United Healthcare Insurance Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Connecticut CT.There is more than one way to treat drug addiction.  For residents of Connecticut, programs such as alcohol detox, oxycotin detox, and heroin detox are prevalent in many cities.  Most people think that withdrawal is detox, so they try to “self medicate” or detox by themselves.  Detox programs are actually able to remove drug residue from an addicts system, and are much more effective than simply “going cold turkey” by yourself.  Connecticut is seeing an increase in these types of detox programs. 
      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on.

      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.
