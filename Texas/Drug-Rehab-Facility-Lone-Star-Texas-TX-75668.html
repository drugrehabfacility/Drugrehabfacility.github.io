      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.

      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death.

      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      More than 10% of all heroin overdose deaths that occurred in the U. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.
