      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.
