      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
