      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
