      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
