    <p>
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States.To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. 
      Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person.
