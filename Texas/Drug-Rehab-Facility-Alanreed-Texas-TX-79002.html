      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Medication Assisted Detox - Drug Detox Centers Medication assisted detox is a common form of drug detox. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has.
