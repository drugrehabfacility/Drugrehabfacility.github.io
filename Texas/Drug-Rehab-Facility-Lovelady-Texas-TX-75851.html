      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients.
