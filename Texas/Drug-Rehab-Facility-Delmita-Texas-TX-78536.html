      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life.

      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Known as the Buckeye State, Ohio has brought many great things to the United States. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms – This includes symptoms such as seizures, extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, suicide, muscle aches, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, mood swings and many, many more. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.

      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.

      Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage.
