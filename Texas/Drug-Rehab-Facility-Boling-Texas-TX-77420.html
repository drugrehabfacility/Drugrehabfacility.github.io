      Medical monitoring –Detox patients rest in well-furnished private rooms outfitted with monitoring equipment. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs.
