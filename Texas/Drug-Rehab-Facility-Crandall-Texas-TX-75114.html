      Substance Abuse Treatment 
      Plan </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. 
      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable.
