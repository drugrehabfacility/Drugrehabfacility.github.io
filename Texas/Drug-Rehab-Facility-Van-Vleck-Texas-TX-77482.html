      There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures.

      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin.As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems.

      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.
