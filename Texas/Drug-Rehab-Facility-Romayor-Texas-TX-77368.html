      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      A growing number of drug treatment centers in Connecticut have services for the hearing impaired. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      When you are considering a facility for drug detox in Connecticut, consider a service that will not only be safe and effective but will also keep you comfortable.

      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.
