      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms.

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.

      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.

      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse.If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
