      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Paying for Treatment Ultimately, paying for amphetamine rehab in Ohio is a matter of accessing available health insurance options or using your existing health plan. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.
