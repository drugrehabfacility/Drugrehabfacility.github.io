Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas.
