      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. 
      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
