      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free.
