      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. 
      Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.

      Willow Springs offers customized treatment based on your needs, with expert staff, including medical practitioners, psycho- and physical therapists, nutritionists and spiritual guides. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol. 
      Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.
