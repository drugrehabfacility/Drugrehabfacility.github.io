      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. Alcoholics Anonymous isn't an organization you can see a few occasions and consider yourself "cured." Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is among the very best treatment choices for a recovering alcoholic.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
