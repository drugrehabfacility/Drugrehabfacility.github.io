      Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal.
