      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
