      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable.
