      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      We certainly do care about aesthetics and making our guests feel comfortable, but your treatment is our utmost priority. Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Use our Online Verification Form to check your plan’s coverage. Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.

      Treatment Drug Detox </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own.
