      Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined.
