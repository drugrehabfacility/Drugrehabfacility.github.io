      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.
