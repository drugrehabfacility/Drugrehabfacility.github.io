      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. Combining natural medicine and care with traditional medicine can be the most effective detox methods.
