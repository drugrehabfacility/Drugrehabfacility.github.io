      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. This is primarily for safety and security of the patient. 
      Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs. IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).
