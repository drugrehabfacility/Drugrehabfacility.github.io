      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs.
