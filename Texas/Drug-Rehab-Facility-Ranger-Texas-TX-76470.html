      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      Drug detox, UROD, ibogaine therapy, naltrexone implant, anti drug craving treatment, oxyven, xenon gas, blood detoxification, plasmapheresis , lymphatic drainage... The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Make the call and get him or her the help needed today. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process.
