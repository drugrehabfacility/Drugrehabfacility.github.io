      There are multiple reasons to choose detoxes in MA. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly.

      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs.

At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.

Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.
