      Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance.
