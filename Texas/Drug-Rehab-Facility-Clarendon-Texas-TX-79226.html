      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. 
      Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.

      The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective.
