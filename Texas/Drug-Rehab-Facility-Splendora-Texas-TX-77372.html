      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts.

      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense.

      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
