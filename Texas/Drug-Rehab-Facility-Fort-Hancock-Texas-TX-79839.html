      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Above the Standard: I believe in only working with people and centers that I personally trust.
