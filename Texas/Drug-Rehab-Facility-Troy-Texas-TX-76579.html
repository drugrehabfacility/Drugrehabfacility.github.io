      Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription.

      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? Counselors are available by both email and telephone. 
      Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.
