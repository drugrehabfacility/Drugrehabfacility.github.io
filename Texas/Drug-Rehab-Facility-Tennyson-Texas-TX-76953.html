      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body.

      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
