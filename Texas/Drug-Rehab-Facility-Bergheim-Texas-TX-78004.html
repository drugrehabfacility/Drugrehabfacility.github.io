      What are the kinds of treatments found in Chicago drug detox centers? 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.
