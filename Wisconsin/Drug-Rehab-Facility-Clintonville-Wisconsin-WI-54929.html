      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. Holistic program options are also available in Ohio. 
      The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction.
