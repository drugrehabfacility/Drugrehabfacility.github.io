      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms.
