      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there.
