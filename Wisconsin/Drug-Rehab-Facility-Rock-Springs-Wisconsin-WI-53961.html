      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Cocaine and methamphetamine users can almosr always safely withdraw in a non-medical detox center in Connecticut. 
      You can get information about these treatments centers and their rehab programs from the Internet. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.

      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.
