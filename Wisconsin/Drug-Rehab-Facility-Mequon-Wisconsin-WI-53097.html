      When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
