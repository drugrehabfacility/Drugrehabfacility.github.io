      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.

      The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient. She had a concerned look on her face so I explained that Arianna has autism, and that in her mind, because the cheeseburger was cut in half, she thinks its broken and can’t eat it. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      I am grateful for this facility and hope anyone in need of detox chooses this place. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well.
