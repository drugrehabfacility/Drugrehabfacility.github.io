      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Group Therapy: Drug use and addiction turns many addicts into introverted isolationists. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse.

      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment.

      Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?!Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program.

      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source.
