      I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs.
