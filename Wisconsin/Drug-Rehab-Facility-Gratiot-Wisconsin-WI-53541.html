      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.

    <p>
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason.
