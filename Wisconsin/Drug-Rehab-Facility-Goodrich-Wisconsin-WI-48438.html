      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      If Roger Ebert was still alive, he would give Detox of South Florida two thumbs up! A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment.
