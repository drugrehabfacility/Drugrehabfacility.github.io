      Drug detox, UROD, ibogaine therapy, naltrexone implant, anti drug craving treatment, oxyven, xenon gas, blood detoxification, plasmapheresis , lymphatic drainage... People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem.
