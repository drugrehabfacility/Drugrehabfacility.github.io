      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.

For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
