      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming.

      Anyone willing and capable of following my counsel can get well again" The major questions that determine which type of detox withdrawal program a person requires are: How ill are they? 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient.
