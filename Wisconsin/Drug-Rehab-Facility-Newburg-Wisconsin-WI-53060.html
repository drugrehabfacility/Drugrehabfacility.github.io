      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 - OR - Request a Callback The Orchid Recovery Center is located in Palm Springs, FL and provides residential detox and rehab treatment to women. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      This is done at an individual or a group level, Fairview UT 84629 and may cover crisis counseling and daily/weekly counseling support.
