      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. 
      Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle.
