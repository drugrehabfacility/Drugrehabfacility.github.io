      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems. 800-483-2193 800-483-2193 Get help for your loved one FEATURED CENTERS Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 Family is Forever. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.
