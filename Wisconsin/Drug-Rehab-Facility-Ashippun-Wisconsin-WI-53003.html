      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Give us a call and we’ll help you to find the perfect place for you in this wonderful state.
