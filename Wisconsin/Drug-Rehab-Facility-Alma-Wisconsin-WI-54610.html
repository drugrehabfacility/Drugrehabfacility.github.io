      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
