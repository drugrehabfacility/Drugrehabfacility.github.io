      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
