      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings.

      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
