      The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.
