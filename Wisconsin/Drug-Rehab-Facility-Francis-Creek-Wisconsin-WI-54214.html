      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.

      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain.As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain.
