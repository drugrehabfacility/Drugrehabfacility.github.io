      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      There are many different types of detox centers, including Medical detox facilities Alcohol detox facilities Drug detox facilities Rapid detox facilities Holistic detox facilities Inpatient detox facilities Outpatient detox facilities Depending on your needs and your comfort level with certain types of treatment, one of these programs may be the best option for your needs. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. It gets rid of the toxic chemicals that have built up in your system from drug use. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.

      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine.There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States.
