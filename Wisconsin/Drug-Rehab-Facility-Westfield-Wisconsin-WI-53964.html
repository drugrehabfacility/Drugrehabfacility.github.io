      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.
