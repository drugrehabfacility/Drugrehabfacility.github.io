      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction.

    </p>
    <p>
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. If you are a resident of Illinois and you need to resort to the treatment programs meted out by these organizations, you will find the Chicago detox centers useful. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal.
