      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      Call now for more information on drug abuse or addiction. Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. 
      PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.

      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. 
      By the time detox becomes necessary, the body has temporarily forgotten how to produce positive sensations. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.
