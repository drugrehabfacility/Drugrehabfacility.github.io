      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab.

      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients.
