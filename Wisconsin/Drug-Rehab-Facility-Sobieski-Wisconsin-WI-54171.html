      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids.
