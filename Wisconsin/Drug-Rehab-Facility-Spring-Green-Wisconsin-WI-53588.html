      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. 
      If you have any problem while you are here, the techs and Kevin help resolve the issue in a professional manner.

      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services.For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
