      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery! 
      She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again. When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. 
      With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses.

      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered.
