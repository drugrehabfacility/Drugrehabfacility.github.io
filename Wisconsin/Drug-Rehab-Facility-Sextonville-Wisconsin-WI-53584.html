      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. 
      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction.
