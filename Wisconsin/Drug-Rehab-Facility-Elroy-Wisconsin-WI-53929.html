      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is.
