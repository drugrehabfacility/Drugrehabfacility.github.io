      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox.

      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior.
