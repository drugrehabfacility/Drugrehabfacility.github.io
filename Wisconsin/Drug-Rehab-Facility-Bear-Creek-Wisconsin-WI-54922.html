      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source.
