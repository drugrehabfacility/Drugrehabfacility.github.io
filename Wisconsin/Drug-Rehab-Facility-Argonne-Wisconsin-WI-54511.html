      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. The most common of these drug detox programs is Christian drug detox. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.

      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
