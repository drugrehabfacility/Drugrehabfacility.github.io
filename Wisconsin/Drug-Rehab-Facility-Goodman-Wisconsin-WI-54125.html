      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members.
