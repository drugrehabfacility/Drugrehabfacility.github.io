      Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 - OR - Request a Callback Palm Partners Treatment Center is one of the most successful drug rehab centers in the country at a fraction of the price of other addiction treatment centers. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens.

      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
