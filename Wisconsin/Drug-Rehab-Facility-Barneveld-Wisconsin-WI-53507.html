      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      Nevada is an anomaly when it comes to drug detox center admissions, though. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.
