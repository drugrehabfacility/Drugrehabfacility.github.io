      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.

      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.

      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing.
