      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender.
