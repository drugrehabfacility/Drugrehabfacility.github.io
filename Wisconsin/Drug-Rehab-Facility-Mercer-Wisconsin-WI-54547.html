      Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean.

Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
