      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.

Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.
