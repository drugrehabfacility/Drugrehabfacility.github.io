      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab.

Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
