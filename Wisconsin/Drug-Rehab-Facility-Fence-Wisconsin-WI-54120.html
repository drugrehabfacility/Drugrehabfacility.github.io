      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
