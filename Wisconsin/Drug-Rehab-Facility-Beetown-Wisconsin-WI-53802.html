      You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you.Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy.
