      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain.
