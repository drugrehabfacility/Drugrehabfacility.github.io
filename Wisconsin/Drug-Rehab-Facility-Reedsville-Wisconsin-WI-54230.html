      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. Cognitive behavioral therapy: Your addiction didn’t happen in a vacuum. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. 
      These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals.

      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.

      Serene Setting Panoramic windows, abundant natural light, and a soothing color palette promote well-being. This can be seen in the cultural festivals, architecture, and history museums around the city. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs.
