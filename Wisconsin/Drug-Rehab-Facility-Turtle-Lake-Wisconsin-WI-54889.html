      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount.
