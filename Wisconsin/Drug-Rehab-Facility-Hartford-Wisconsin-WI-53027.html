      Respectfully, STARNER JONES, MD 876566 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 8 months Ago I want to share the experience that my husband, 7 year old autistic sister and I had today at the Chili’s location in Midvale, UT. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      It gets rid of the toxic chemicals that have built up in your system from drug use. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined.
