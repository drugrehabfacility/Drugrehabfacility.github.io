      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.
