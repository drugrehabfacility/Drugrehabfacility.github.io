      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      At Addiction Detox Centers, a full restorative evaluation will be conducted to determine what program best fits their need based on particular drug usage and habits.
