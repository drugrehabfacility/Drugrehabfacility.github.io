      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week!
