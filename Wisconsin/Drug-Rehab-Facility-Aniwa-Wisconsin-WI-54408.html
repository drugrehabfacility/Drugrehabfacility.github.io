      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.
