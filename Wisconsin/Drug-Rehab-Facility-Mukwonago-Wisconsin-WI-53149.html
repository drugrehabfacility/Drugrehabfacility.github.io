      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. For a complete list of items we provide and items you should bring, please contact our Admissions team. 
      Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option.

If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission. We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help.
