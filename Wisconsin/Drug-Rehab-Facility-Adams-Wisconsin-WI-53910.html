      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.
