      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit.

      Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage.

Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.
