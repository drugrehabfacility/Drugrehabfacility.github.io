      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. A growing number of drug treatment centers in Maryland have services for the hearing impaired. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment?
