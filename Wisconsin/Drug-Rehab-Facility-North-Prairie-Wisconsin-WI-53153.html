      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. 
      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. At Addiction Detox Centers, a full restorative evaluation will be conducted to determine what program best fits their need based on particular drug usage and habits. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse.
