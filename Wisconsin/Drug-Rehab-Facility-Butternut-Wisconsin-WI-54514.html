      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
