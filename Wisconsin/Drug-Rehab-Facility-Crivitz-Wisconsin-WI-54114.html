      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.

      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.
