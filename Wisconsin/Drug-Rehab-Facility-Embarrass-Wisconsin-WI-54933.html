      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. 
      We provide the best, most economical and efficient treatment possible for all who need our care. * Inpatient medical detoxing * Residential drug rehab * Outpatient rehabilitation * Subsequent alcohol and drug dependency treatment The most important first step to healing is cleansing from the compound. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery.
