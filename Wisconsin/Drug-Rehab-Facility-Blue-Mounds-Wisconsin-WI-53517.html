      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug.
