      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
