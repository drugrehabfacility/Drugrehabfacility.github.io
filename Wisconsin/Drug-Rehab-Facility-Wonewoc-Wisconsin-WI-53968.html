      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer.
