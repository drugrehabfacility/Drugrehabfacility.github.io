      Detox withdrawal advice may begin after doctors advices, hospital visits and personal attempts prove ineffective. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible.
