      The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it.
