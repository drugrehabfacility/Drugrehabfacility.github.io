      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      It is always advisable to inquire about scholarships or grants available for low-income individuals when seeking a treatment center. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
