      Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox?
