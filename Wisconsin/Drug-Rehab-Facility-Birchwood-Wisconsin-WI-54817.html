      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. On average, detox takes 5 days, but can range from 3 to 10 days. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative.
