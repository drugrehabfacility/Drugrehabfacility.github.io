      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process.

      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. Medical detox centers offer inpatient detoxification services to patients who are already in the treatment facility or who plan on being admitted into treatment following their detoxification. 
      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from.
