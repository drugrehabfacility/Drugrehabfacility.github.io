    <p>
      If you have any questions or comments about our detox facility, please contact United Drug Rehab Group directly.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.

      While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE!
