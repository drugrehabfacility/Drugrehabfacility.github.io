      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications? The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day.In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs.

      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      You can get information about these treatments centers and their rehab programs from the Internet. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
