      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.

      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction.
