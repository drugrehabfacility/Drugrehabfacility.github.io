      With so much contrast and such a tourist-driven city at the state’s core, it comes as no surprise that people in the Nevada area do have their fair share (and sometime more than their fair share) of challenges and struggles. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
