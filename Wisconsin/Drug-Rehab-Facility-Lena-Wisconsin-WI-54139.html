      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly.

      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful.
