      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment.

      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
