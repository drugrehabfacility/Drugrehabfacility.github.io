      A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation). Cocaine and methamphetamine users can almosr always safely withdraw in a non-medical detox center in Connecticut. 
      In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      My next interest is to save you unnecessary rehab expenses wherever possible.
