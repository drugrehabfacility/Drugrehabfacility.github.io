      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life.
