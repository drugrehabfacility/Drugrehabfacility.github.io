      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. 
      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
