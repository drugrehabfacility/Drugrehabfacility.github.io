      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs.
