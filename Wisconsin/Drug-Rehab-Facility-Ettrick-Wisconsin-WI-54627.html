      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance.
