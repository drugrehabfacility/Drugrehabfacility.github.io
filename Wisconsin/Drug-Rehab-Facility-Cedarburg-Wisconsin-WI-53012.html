      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. 
      This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. Ohio is one of the five national states with the highest rate of overdose deaths.
