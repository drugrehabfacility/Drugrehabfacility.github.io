      Soft Landing Recovery, Oakbrook Terrace (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Soft Landing Recovery has an “at home” outpatient recovery that specializes in helping those with addiction to painkillers and opiates. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.

      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Rather, we offer an educational cognitive behavioral education program that helps you identify the habits that led you to choose drugs and help you create different habits and a more fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them.
