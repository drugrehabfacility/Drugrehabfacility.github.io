      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. 
      There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision.

      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.

      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. You may have: Anxiety Delirium tremens (DTs), a life-threatening issue where you feel confused and on edge Depression Hallucinations, where you see or hear things that aren’t there Problems sleeping Shakiness, especially in your hands Unstable changes in blood pressure and heart rate Do I Need a Detox Program?

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut.

      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery.Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.
