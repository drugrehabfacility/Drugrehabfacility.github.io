      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.

      For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better.

      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      There are many explanations for why giving up alcohol needs a critical dedication. Excellent detox which rejuvenates life is essential to make significant gains in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.
