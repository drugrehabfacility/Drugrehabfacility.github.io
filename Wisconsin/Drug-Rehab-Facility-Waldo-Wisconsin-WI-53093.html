      31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment.While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.
