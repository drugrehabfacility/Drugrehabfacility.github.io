      Bar none, Detox of South Florida is the best care I have received. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.

Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor.
