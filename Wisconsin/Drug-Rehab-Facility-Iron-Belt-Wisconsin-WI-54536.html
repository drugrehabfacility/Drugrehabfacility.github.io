      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.

      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. 
      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal.
