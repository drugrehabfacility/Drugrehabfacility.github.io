Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse.
