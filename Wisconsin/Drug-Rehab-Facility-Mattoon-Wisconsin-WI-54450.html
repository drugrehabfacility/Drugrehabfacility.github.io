      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. 
      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help.
