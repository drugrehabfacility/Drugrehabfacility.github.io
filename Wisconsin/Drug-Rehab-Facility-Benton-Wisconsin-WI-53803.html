      These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab.
