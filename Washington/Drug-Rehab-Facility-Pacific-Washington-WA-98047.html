      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.
