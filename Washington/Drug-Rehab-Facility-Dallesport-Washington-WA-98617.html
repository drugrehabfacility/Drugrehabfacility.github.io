      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with.
