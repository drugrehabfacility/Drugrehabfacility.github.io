      This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Alcohol and drug withdrawal detox programs in Connecticut, CT include: Medical detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, alcohol detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, drug detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, opiate detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, suboxone detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, vicodin detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, ultracet detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, methadone detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, methamphetamine "Crystal meth" detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, and detoxification centers and programs using suboxone and buprenorphine in Connecticut, CT. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
