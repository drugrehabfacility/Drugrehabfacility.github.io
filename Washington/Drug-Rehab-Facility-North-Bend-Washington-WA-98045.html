      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have.
