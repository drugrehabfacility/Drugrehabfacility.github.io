      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high).
