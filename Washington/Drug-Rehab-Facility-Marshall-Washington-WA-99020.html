      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used.
