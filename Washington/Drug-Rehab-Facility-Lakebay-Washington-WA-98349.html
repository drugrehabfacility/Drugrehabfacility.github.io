      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Patients are given sedation if needed and IV vitamin infusions.
