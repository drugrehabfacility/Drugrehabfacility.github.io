      Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. 
      Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.

      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.
