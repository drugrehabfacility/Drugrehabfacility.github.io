      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.
