      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. 
      Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Those detoxing can also become dependent on these drugs and start abusing them. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
