      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.
