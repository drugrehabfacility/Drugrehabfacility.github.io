      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      Whether you’re having nausea or you feel like you need someone to speak with, our professionals will be there for you. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs.
