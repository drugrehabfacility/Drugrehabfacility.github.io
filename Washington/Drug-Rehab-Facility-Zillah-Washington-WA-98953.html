      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.

      It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.
