      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery.
