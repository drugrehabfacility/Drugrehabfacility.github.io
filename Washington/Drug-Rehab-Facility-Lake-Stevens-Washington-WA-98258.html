      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Finding these centers is often just a matter of talking to the leaders of these faith traditions to connect with the resources. We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. 
      Detox Withdrawal Advice We help you find a truly effective alcohol or benzo detox and rehab. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      When you search, you'll get a list of drug rehab facilities that includes information about the rehabilitation center.

      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.

      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery.
