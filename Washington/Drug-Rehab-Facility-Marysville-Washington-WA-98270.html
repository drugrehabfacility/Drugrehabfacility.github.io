    <p>
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.To Begin Your Journey On A Successful Recovery Program Call 1-877-752-6506 As part of our series of best rehab centers across the nation, we now present the ten best rehab centers in Illinois. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage.
