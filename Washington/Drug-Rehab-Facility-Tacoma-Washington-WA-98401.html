      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Vitamin Depletion and Drug Use Pharmaceuticals, drugs and alcohol burn up, expedite the excretion of, and prevent the absorption of, nutrients and vitamins. 
      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well.
