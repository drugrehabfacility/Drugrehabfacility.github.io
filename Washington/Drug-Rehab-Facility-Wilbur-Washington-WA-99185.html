      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. 
      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process.
