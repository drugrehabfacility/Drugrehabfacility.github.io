      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.
