Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care.
