      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.
