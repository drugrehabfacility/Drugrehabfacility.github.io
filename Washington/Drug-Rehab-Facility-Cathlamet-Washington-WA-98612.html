      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.
