      Your doctor did not tell you how addictive benzos would be. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process.
