      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. 
      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
