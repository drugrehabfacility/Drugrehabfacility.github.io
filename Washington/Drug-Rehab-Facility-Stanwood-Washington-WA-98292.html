      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.

      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
