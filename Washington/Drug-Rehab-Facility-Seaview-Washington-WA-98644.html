      31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      We can help you determine what option is best for you. Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. 
      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox?
