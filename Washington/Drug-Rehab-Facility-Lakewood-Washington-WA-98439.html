      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      Addiction Treatment is Pinnacle Medical Detox Staff In order to overcome a drug or alcohol addiction seeking out treatment from a drug detox center or treatment center is essential. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs.
