      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons.

      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
