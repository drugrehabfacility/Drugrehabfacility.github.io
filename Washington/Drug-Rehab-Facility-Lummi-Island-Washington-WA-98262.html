It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery.
