      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis.
