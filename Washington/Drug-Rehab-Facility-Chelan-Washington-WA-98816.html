      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming.

Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away.

      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Call (866) 578-7471 today to reach a professional interventionist. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work.
