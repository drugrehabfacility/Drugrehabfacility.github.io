      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do.
