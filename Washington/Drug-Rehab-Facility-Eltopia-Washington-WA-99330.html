      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear.
