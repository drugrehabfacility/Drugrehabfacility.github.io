      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use.
