      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option.

People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission. 
      Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others.
