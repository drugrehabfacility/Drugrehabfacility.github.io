      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.
