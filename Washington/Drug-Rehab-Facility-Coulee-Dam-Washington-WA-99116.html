      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.

      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.
