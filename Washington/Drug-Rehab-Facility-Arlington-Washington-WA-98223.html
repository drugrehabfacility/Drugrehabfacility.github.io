      6 percent of the people who needed that treatment. There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses.
