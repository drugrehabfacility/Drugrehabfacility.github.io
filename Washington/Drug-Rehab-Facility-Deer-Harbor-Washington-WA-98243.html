      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
