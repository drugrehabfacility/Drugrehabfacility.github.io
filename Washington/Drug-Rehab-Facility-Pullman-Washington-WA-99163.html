      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober?

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 5750 Your Confidentiality is Guaranteed America's Non 12 Step Program Get Help Now Your confidentiality is guaranteed. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free.

      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly.
