      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts.
