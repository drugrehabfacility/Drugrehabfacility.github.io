      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.
