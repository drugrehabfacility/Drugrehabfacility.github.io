      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. 
      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals.
