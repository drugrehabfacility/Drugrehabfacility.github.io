      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
