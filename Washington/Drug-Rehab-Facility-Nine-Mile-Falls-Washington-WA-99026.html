      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases.

You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years.

      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.

      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      When you search, you'll get a list of drug rehab facilities that includes information about the rehabilitation center. In the various drug detoxification programs and alcohol detox treatments, the body is purged of the poisons accumulated in the body as a consequence of addiction. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more.Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Medical monitoring and physical care are provided as well as meals, social support and other services to ensure the safety and sobriety of the individual. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.

      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. 
      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths.
