      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Call (866) 578-7471 today to reach a professional interventionist.
