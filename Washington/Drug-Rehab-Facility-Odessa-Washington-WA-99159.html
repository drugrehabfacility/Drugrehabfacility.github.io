      These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse.
