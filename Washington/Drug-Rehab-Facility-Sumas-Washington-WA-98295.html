      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them. They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life.

      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite.
