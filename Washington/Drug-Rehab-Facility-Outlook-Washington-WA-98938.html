      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.

      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. Like vomiting, irritation, nausea, nostril, chill.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope.
