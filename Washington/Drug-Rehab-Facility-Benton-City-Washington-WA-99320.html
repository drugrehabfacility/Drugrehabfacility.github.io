      Addiction isn't brought on by the drug, but is brought on by biological and mental vulnerabilities resulting in a variety of kinds of craving." Step one would be to realize the addiction. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. 
      This will make finding exactly what you need at the nearest drug detox center facility to your family.
