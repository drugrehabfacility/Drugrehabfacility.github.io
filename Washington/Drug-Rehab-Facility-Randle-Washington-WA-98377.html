      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help.
