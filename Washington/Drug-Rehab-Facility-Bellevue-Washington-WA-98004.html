      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. 
      That’s why we’re here – to guide you along the path to recovery, one step at a time. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
