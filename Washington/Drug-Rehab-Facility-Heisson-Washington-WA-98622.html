      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      We then came up with a final ranking, and filtered out the very best for this list. Those executive level centers have been selected which meet and exceed expectations.

Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
