      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. We will then go over the best plan as to get you enrolled in that facility.

      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Outpatient medical detox used methadone and suboxone replacement therapies. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.

      This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good.

      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.For the person interested in history and heritage, Cincinnati’s culture was largely influenced by the large numbers of German and Irish immigrants who settled the area.
