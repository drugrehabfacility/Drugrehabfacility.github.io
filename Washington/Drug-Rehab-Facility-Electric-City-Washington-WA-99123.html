      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction.

Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.
