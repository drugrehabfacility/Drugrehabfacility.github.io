      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.
