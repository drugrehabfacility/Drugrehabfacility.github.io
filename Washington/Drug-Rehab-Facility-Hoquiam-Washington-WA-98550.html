      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. 
      But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.
