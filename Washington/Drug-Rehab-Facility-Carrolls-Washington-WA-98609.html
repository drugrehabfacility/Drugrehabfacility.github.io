      Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction.
