      Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief.

      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab.
