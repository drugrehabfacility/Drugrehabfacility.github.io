      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.

      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own.

The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether.
