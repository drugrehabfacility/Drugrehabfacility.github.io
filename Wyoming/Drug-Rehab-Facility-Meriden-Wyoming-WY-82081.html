      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      Drugs distributed into Chicago are intended not only for the resident market but also for states across the country. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem.

      Some of these symptoms can be medically dangerous and lead to damaging side effects. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option.Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.
