      Most of the times the medication given at detox facilities in Washington are a safety matter because some withdrawal symptoms can be fatal. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible.

      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
