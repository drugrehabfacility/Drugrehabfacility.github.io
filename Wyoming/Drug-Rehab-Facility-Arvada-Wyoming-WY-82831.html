      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
