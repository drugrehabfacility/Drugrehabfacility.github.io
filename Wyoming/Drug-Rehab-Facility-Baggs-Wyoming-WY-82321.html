      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. 
      Call now to speak with a caring treatment specialist. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function.
