      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions.

Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab.
