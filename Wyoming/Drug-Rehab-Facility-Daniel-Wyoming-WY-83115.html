      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares.

For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control.
