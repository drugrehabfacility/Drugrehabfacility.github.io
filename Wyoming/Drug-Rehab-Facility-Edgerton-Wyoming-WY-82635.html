      When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 24-Hour Care At our addiction treatment center, individuals receive 24-hour medical care that which includes psychiatric and nursing care as well as personalized wellness and medication plans. 
      Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. 
      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.

      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict.
