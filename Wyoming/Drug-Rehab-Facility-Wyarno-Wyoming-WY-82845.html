      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. Personal events, trauma and the environment does affect drug use. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function.
