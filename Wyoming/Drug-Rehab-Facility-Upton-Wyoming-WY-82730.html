      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. Our treatment helpline will connect you with facilities in Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and West Haven as well as throughout all other areas of the state. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.
