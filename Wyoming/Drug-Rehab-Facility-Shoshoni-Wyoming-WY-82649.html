      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program.
