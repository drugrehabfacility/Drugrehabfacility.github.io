      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. If Roger Ebert was still alive, he would give Detox of South Florida two thumbs up!
