      Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.
