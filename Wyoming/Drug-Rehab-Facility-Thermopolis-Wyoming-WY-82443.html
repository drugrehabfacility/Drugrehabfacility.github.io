      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.
