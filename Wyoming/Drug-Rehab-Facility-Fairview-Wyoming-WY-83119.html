      Individual therapy: You meet one-on-one with a psychologist/psychiatrist. New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. Once under general anesthesia and deep sedation, the opiate antagonist is administered and also a strict formula of medications specifically designed to flush out the patients opiate receptors. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.
