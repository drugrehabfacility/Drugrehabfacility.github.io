      What worked for me were the awesome social activities and the involvement of my instructor. Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. Some of these drug rehab centers in Ohio are situated on 10-15 acres of land and offer long-term treatment programs, and some offer programs lasting less than a month. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. 
      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox.
