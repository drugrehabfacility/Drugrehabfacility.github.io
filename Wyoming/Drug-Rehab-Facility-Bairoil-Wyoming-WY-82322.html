      We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
