      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own. All provided by a counseling service that works 24 hours a day that can give you an early appointment or schedule a medical visit if that is what you require by the time you call them up.

      For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them.

      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases.
