      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
