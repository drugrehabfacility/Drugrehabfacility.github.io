      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.
