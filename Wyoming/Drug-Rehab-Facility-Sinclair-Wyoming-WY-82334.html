      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab.

      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions.
