      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. We want to assist you in finding the best New Jersey detox centers for your recovery. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month.
