      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. 
      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more.
