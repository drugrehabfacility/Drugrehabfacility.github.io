      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. 
      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE!
