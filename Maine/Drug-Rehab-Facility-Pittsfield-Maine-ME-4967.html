      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.

      Ohio rehab centers are gold standard centers for addiction treatments. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go.
