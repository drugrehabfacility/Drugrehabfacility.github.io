      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe.
