      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience. 
      Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox.

      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction.
