      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. 
      If you have any questions or comments about our detox facility, please contact United Drug Rehab Group directly.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.

      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
