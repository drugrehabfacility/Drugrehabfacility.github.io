      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
