      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications.
