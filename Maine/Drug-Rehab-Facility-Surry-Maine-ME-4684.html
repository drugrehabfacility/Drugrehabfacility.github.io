      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Here at United Drug Rehab Group, our wide network of specialists run a detox program that not only accommodates to the physical and emotional needs of our guest, but has also been proven to have a high recovery rate. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure.
