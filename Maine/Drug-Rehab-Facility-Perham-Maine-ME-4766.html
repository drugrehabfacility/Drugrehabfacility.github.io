      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. 
      Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse.
