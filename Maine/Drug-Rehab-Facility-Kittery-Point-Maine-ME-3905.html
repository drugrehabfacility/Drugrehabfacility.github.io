      RDD Center admits patients to our licensed surgical facility for the detoxification procedure to guarantee the proper monitoring and medical care.

      A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. Getting the right detox withdrawal advice will save your life.

      If you are skeptical of their success, you need only to head over to their Facebook page, where thousands of former clients and members of the community come together.
