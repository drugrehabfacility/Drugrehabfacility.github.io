      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable.
