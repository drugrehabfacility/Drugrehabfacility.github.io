      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. 
      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      A growing number of drug treatment centers in Massachusetts have services for the hearing impaired.
