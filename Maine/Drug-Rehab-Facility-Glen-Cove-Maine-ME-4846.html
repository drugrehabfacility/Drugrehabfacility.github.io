      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.

      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.

      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.
