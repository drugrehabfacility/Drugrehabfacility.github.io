      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      The most common reason that people seek out treatment from a drug detox center in the state of Nevada is for stimulant abuse and addiction, namely meth (methamphetamine). If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. 
      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive.The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.

      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery.
