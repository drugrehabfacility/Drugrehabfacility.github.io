      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.
