      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort.
