      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
