      With specialized treatment programs for teens and young adults, and supportive environments for adult patients, we provide more than just drug detox facilities. 
      No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built.
