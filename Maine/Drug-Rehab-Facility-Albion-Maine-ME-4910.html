      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment.

      Respectfully, STARNER JONES, MD 876566 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 8 months Ago I want to share the experience that my husband, 7 year old autistic sister and I had today at the Chili’s location in Midvale, UT. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. 
      She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again. I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
