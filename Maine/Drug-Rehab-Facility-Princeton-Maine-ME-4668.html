      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it.
