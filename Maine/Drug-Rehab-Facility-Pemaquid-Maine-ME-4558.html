      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
