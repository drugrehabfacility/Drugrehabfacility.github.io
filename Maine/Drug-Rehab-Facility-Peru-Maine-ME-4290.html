      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober.
