      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances.

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days.
