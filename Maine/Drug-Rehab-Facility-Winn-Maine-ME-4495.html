      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. 
      As a person begins to feel better, they can begin to take a more active part in the therapy part of rehab. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain.

      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs.
