      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support.

Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now.
