      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      Find an Amphetamine Addiction Treatment Center As addiction affects different people in different ways, there’s no “one-size-fits-all” approach to drug treatment. Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery.
