      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      A blockagge that does not allow the patient the possibility to return to drugs at all so patient is not interested in drugs anymore. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated.
