      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body.

    </p>
    <p>
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.

      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. That is why our clinical specialists are always on standby, ready to assist you in all that you need. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life.

      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. 
      There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals.Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      Call 800-483-2193 today so you or your loved one can get the best care possible in your home state. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. The manager, Bradley Cottermole, then came to our table, kneeled down, and said to Arianna, “I heard we gave you a broken cheeseburger! 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
