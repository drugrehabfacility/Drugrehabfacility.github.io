A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs.

      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work.
