      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. 
      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs.
