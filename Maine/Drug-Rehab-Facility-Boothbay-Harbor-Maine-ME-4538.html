Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
