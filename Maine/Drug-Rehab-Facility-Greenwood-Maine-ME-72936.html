      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort.
