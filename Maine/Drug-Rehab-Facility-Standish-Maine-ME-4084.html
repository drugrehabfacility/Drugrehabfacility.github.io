      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.

      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
