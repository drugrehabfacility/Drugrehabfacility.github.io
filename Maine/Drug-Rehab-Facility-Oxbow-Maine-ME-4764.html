      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation.

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction.
