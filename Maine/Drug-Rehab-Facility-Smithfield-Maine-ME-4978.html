      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. Do you know someone who is looking for a drug and alcohol detox center in Illinois? 
      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms.
