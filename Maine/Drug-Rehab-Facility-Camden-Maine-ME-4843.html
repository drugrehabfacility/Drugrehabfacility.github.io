      Connecticut, CT offers some of the best detoxification centers and facilities for drug and alcohol withdrawal from substance abuse. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.

      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
