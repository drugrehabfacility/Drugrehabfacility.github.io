      Quick drug detox is the most efficient method of drug addiction treatment.Drug Detox in New Jersey Finding The Best Drug Detox In NJ The Need For Drug Detox In New Jersey With drug use in New Jersey increasing each year, the need for drug detox facilities has also increased. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.
