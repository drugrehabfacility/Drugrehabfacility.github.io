      Motivational incentives: it makes use of positive things meant to encourage the patient to abstain from addictive substances. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
