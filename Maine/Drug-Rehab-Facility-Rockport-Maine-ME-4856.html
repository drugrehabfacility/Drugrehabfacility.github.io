      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use.
