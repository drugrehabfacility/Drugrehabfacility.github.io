      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
