      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. 
      Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.
