      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process.
