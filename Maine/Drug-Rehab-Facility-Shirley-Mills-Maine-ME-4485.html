      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.
