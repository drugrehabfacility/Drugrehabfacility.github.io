      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
