      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. 
      We provide a means to achieve physical, mental and emotional healing. They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms.
