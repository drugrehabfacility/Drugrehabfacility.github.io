      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Call our helpline at 800-483-2193 toll-free to speak with a specialist about your recovery needs. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction.
