      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      You may have: Anxiety Delirium tremens (DTs), a life-threatening issue where you feel confused and on edge Depression Hallucinations, where you see or hear things that aren’t there Problems sleeping Shakiness, especially in your hands Unstable changes in blood pressure and heart rate Do I Need a Detox Program?
