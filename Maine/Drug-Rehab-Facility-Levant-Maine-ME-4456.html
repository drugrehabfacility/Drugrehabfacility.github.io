      The Woods at Parkside, Gahanna (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today “Where recovery takes root,” The Woods at Parkside is a drug and alcohol addiction treatment center situated on 11 acres and overlooks a golf course. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Those executive level centers have been selected which meet and exceed expectations. There are many people going through what you are right now. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction.
