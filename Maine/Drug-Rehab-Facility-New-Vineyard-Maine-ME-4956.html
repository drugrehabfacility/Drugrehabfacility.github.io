Drug Detox may be achieved without the use of medications, in some cases drugs may be prescribed or administered to ease the withdraw symptoms. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. Drug & Alcohol Detox Centers in Ohio Find local treatment centers near your city.
