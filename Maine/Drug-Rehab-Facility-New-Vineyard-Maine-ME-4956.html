      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. 
      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program.

      I need another one thats fixed.” Then it dawned on me why she wasn’t eating it. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab.
