      1-800-819-9973 When Is An Inpatient Detox Necessary? 
      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.

      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. 
      Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab.
