      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more.

Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong.

      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.
