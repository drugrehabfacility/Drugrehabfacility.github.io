      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover.

      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
