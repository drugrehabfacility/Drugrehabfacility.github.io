When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. Decide to interact with others in the "living room" around the fireplace, or in front of one of many large, flat screen digital TVs packed with premium programming. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.
