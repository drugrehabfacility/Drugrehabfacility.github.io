      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      Whether you are looking for a drug detox in Boston or any other area, we can help. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.

      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.
