      Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
