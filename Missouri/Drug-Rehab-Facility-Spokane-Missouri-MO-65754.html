      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. 
      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox.

This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy.

      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. 
      She had a concerned look on her face so I explained that Arianna has autism, and that in her mind, because the cheeseburger was cut in half, she thinks its broken and can’t eat it. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school.
