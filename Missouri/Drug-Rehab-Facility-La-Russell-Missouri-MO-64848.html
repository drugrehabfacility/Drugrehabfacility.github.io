      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol.

      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
