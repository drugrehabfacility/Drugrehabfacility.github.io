      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. Quick drug detoxification allows us to clean the receptors completely.
