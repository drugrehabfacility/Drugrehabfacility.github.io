      Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward.
