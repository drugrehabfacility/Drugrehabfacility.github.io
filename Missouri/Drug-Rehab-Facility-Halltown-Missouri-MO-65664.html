      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.
