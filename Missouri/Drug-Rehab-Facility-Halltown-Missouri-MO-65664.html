      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. In the United States, it's the most prevalent of the addictions of the nation.
