      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. 
      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.

      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first.

      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment.
