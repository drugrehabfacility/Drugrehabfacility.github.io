      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Contact Detox.com now to find inpatient drug detox centers near you! 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.

The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention.
