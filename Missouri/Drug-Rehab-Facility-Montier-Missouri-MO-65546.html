      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.
