      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases.

      Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.
