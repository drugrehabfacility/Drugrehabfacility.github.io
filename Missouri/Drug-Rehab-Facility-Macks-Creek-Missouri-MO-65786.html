      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs.

      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings.
