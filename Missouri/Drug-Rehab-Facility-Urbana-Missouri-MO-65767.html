      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used.

      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery.
