      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.
