      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.
