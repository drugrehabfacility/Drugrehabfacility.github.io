      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. 
      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs.

As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year.
