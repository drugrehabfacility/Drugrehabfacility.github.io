      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them.
