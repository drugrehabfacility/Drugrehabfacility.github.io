      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. All others are not considered regardless of media hype. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.

      We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2.
