Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program.

      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse.
