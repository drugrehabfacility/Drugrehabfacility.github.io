      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      Counseling results to intervention which involves seeking professional help by the concerned parties to give the patient the necessary treatment.
