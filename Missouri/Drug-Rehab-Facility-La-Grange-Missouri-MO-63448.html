      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts.
