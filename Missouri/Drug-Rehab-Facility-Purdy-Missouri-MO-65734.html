      Drug detox, UROD, ibogaine therapy, naltrexone implant, anti drug craving treatment, oxyven, xenon gas, blood detoxification, plasmapheresis , lymphatic drainage... You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
