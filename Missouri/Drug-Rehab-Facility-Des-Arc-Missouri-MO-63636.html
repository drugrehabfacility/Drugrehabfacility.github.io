      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      At Addiction Detox Centers, a full restorative evaluation will be conducted to determine what program best fits their need based on particular drug usage and habits. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. All provided by a counseling service that works 24 hours a day that can give you an early appointment or schedule a medical visit if that is what you require by the time you call them up. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.
