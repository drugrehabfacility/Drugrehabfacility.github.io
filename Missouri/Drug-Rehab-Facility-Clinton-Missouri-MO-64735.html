      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.
