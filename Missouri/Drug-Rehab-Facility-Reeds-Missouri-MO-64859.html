      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective.

      Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. Their expert staff help with complete medical and psychiatric assessments, individualized care, and spiritual renewal for the whole family.

      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. 
      Motivational incentives: it makes use of positive things meant to encourage the patient to abstain from addictive substances.Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation).We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. 
      The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions. It is possible to find many alcoholics in every area. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery.
