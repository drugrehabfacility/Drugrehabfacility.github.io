      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs.
