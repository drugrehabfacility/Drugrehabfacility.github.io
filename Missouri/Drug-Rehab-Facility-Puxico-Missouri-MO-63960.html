      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
