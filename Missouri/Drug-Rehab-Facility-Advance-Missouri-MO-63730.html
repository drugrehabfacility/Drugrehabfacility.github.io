There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. Those who get treated and then quit going to meetings since they believe they're " cured " almost always return to drinking eventually. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life.
