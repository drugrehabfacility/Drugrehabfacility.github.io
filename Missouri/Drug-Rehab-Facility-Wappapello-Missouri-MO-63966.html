      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you.

      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.
