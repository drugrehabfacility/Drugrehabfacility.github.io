      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center?

      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.
