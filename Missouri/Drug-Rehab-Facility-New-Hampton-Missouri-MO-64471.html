      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. The best Holistic detox and rehab centers will do more than yoga and meditation. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.
