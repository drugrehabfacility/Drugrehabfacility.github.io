      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. You should have the actual desire to be back to the strong person you know you deserve to be, and all you have to do is get over this ugly step and there will be such an amazing future for you, something you can’t even imagine.

      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available.
