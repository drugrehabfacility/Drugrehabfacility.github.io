      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut. 
      In the each situation I have learned "from you" to look at the positive, in everything however small it may seem. Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. The particular Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois even offers this medication regarding Clonidine as well as Naltrexone through the detox procedure.
