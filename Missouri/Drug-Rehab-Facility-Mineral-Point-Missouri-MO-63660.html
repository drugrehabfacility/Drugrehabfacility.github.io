      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. 
      Physical dependence is one of the most difficult parts of any addiction to overcome but with the help of detox centers and the specialized programs, medications, therapists and medical interventionist who provide care at these facilities, those who suffer from even the strongest of addictions can get past the physical dependence that keeps them using drugs or alcohol and prepare for psychological recovery. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.
