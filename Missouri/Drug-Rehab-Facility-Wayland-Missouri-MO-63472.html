Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.
