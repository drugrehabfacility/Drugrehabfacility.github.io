      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
