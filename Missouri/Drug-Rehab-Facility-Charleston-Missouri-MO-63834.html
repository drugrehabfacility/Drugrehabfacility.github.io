      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      A good residential treatment facility will be able to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to the needs of each patient. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. However, if you are like most individuals and families you want to find drug detox centers near me and you want to know what type of health insurance plan will cover treatments for your loved one. 
      Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.
