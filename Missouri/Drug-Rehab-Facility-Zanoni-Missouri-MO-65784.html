Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach.
