      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      Individual Attention The small size of our program, coupled with our high staff-to-client ratio, ensures that each client receives the highest level of individual attention during their alcohol or drug detox treatment. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. 
      You will get numerous diverse answers on how to avoid relapse such as; staying positive, going to meeting or groups and staying associated to your peers. 4) Methadone Clinic in Connecticut: A methadone clinic is not actually a “detox”, although methadone is sometimes used to help someone to stop using opiates.

Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery.
