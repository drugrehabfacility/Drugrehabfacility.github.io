An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism.

    <p>
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal.
