      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs.
