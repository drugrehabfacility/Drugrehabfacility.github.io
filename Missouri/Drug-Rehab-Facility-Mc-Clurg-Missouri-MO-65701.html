      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Give us a call and start the recovery process today.  1-800-819-9973 Rapid Detox Drug and Alcohol Detoxification has long been accepted as an essential, first step towards recovery from addiction. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.
