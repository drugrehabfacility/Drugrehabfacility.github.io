      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out.

Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center.
