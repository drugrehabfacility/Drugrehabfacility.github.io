      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system.
