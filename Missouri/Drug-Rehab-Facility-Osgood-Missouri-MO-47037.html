      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Alcohol and drug withdrawal detox programs in Connecticut, CT include: Medical detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, alcohol detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, drug detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, opiate detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, suboxone detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, vicodin detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, ultracet detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, methadone detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, methamphetamine "Crystal meth" detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT, and detoxification centers and programs using suboxone and buprenorphine in Connecticut, CT. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
