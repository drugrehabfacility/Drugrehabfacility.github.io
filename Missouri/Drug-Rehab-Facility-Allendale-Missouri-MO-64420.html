      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober?An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process.
