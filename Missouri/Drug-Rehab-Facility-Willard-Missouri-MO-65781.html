      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. 
      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path.
