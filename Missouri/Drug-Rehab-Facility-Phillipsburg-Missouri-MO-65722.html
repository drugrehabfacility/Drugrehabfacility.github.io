      After Detox Some individuals find it necessary to enroll in an after program after drug detox is completed to help you rebuild your life. Once this information is established, if the state deems that the client cannot pay, they may provide free treatment on various levels through specific types of clinics or treatment centers. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
