      One of the most common drug addictions that Drug Detox Centers Cincinnati area sees is heroin addiction. 
      Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
