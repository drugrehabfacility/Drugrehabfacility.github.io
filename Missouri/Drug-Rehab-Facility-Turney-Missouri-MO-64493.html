      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care.
