      The overall group represents the fact that rehabilitation from drug abuse is possible. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs.
