      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage.
