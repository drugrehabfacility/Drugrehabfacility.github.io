      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.
