      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts.

A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.
