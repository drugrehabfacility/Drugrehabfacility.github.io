      We are here 24 hours a day to answer your questions.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      We can help you determine what option is best for you. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. 
      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. 
      We can help you find a program that's right for you or a loved one.

      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.
