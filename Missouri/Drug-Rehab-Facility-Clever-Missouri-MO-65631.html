      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment. Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center.
