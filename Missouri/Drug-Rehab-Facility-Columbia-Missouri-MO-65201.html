      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). To make it as comfortable as possible for you, we provide you with all necessities as well as an arrange of amenities to make your stay both healing and enjoyable. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.
