      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help.

      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Here at United Drug Rehab Group, our wide network of specialists run a detox program that not only accommodates to the physical and emotional needs of our guest, but has also been proven to have a high recovery rate. 
      Once under general anesthesia and deep sedation, the opiate antagonist is administered and also a strict formula of medications specifically designed to flush out the patients opiate receptors. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      Counselors are available by both email and telephone. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them.
