      As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use?
