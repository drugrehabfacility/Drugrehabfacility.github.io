      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.

      All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program.

      Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.

      If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
