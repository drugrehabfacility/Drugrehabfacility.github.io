      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.

      There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.

      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
