      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      One of the most common drug addictions that Drug Detox Centers Cincinnati area sees is heroin addiction. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
