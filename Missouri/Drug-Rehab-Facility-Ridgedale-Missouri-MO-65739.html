      Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery.
