      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      Drug Detox Programs Many individuals simply cannot or will not deal with the withdrawal symptoms associated with natural detox. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.

      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
