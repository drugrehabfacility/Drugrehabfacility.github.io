      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
