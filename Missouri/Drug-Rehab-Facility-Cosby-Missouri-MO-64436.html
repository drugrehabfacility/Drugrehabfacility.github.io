      In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance. Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. 
      After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
