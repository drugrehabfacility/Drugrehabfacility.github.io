Nevada is a state of stark and surprising natural beauty, wide open spaces, national landmarks and wonders, and (of course) one of the most famous and infamous cities in the world. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs.

      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip.
