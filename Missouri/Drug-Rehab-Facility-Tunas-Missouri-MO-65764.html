      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. 
      Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs.

      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.
