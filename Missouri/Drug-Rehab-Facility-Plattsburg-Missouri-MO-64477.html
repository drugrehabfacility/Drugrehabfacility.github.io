      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful.

    <p>
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
