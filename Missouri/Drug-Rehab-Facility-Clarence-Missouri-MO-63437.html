      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.
