      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      The rehabilitation process has many phases and for someone to have a successful recovery, it is important for them to work hard and be committed during each section of this important and personal course of action.  Once a person decides they need help and wants to make an effort to get clean and sober, anyone in the area looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities can call Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center at (877) 855-3470 and talk to an addiction counselor to hear about all of the available programs.  Searching for rehab facilities and other care centers, including a Miami drug detox, can be a daunting process, but the highly trained professionals at Fort Myers White Sands will answer any questions you may have about your available options.

For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Rather, we offer an educational cognitive behavioral education program that helps you identify the habits that led you to choose drugs and help you create different habits and a more fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle.
