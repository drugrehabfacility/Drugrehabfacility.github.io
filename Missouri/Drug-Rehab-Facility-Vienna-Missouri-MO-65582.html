      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded.Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.
