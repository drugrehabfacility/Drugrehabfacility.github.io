      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems.

      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them.
