      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
