      Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut. This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. 
      This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.
