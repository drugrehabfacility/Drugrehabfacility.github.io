      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment? 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.
