      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
