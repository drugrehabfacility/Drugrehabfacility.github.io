      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.
