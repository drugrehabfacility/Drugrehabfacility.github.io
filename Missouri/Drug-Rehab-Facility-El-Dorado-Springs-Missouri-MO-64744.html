      Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them. 
      For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol. Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. In order to rate the centers, we took into account criteria like staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and effectiveness and, after ranking and filtering the list, now present the 9 best rehabs in Ohio. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
