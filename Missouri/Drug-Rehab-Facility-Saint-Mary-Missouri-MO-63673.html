      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
