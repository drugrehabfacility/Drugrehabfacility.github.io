      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
