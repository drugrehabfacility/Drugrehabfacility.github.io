      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence.
