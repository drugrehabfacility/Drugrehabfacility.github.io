      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Skilled and continuous assessment of medical needs during the detoxification process, and rock solid procedures for dealing with any sort of medical emergency that may occur. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive.

      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.
