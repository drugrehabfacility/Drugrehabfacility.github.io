      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. You’ll find luxury beds, delicious food, and staff support around the clock. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia.
