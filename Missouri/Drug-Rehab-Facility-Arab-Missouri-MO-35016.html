      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
