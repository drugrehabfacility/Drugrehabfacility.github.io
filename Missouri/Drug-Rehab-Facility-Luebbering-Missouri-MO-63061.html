      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008.There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.

Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink.
