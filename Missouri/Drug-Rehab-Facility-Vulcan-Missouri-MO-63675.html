      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
