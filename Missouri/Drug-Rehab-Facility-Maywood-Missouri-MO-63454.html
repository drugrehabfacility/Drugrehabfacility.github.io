      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
