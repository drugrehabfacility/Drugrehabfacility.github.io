      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. They are searching for the same high that the pills gave them. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation). 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
