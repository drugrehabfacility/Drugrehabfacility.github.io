      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal.

      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.

      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.

      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available.Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
