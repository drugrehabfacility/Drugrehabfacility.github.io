      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? 
      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones.

      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.

      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.

      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      You should have the actual desire to be back to the strong person you know you deserve to be, and all you have to do is get over this ugly step and there will be such an amazing future for you, something you can’t even imagine. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery.
