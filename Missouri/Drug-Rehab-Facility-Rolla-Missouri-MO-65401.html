      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.

      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others.
