    </p>
    <p>
      Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
