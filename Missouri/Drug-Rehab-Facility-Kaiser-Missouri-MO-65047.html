      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.
