      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others.

As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction.
