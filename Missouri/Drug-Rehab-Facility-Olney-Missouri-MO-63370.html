      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Fill in the contact form below or give us a call. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox.
