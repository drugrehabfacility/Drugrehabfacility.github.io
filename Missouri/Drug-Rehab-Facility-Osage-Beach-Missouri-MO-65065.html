      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. Serene Setting Panoramic windows, abundant natural light, and a soothing color palette promote well-being. 
      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be? Although integrative medicine is easily the most popular and effective treatment strategy for any health problem, currently there are only a few integrative medical detox centers in North America. 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life.
