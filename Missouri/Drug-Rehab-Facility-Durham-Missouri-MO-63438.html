      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.
