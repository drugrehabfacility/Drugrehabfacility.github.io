      1 percent, indicating a need for readily available detox and rehab services. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE).

    <p>
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment.
