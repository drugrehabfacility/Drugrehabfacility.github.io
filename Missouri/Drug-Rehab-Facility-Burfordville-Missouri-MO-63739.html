      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective.
