      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
