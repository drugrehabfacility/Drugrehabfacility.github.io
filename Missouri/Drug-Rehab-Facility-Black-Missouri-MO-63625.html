      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Drug Detox may be achieved without the use of medications, in some cases drugs may be prescribed or administered to ease the withdraw symptoms.

      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Getting Help in Illinois Do not feel alone in your fight against your addiction.
