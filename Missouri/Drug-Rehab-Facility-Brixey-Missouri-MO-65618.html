      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.

      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. You will get numerous diverse answers on how to avoid relapse such as; staying positive, going to meeting or groups and staying associated to your peers. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope.
