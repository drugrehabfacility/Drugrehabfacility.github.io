      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance.
