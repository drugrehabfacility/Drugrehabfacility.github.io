      A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. 
      At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. 
      To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor.

      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.
