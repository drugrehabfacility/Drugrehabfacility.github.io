      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Detox may occur in any of the following settings: Inpatient detox Hospital detox Outpatient detox Medical detox Choosing to get help at one of the many detox centers in Illinois is your first step toward healing and sobriety. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. 
      Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. 
      Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more.

      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.
