      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      1-800-819-9973  We will help you find an inpatient detox center today. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.

      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method.

Withdrawal symptoms experienced by abusers and addicts can begin to experience withdraw symptoms as early as a day after the use has stopped.
