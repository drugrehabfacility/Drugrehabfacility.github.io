      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.

      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.

      Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many.
