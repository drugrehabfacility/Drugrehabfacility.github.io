      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure.

      Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms.
