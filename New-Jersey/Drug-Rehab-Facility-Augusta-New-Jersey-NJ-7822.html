      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Massachusetts; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures.

      Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. 
      Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community.
