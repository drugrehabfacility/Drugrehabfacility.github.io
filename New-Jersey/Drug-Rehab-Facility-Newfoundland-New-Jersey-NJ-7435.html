      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. 
      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions.
