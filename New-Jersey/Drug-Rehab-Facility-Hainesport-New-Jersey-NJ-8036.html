      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Vitamin Depletion and Drug Use Pharmaceuticals, drugs and alcohol burn up, expedite the excretion of, and prevent the absorption of, nutrients and vitamins. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere.

      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.

      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. 
      State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more.
