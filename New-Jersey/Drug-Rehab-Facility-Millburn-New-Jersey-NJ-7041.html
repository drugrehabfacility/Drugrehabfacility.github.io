      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. Those detoxing can also become dependent on these drugs and start abusing them. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.

      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms Drug detoxification varies depending on the treatment but at Addiction Drug Detox Centers, counseling and therapy are combined to help with the consequences of withdrawal. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender.
