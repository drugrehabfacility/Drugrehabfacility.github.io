      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction.
