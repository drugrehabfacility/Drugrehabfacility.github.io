      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance.

      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. 
      The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more.
