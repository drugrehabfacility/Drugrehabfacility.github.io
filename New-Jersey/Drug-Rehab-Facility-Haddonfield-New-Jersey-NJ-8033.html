      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. Our recommended integrative detox centers deliver more effective and sympathetic levels of care than Sierra Tucson, the Meadows or McLean Hospital to name a few. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.

This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem.
