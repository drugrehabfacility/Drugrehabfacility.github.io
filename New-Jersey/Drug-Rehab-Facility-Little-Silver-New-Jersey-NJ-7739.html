Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program.
