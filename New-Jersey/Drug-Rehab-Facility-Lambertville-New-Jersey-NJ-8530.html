The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? 
      Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time.
