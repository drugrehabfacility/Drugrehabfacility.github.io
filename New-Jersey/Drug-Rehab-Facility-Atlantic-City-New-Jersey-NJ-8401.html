      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis.

      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
