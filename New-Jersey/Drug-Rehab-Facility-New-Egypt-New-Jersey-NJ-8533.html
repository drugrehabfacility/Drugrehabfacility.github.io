      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom.

However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them.
