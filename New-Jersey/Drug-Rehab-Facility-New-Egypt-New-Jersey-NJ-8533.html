      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. 
      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using.
