      This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.
