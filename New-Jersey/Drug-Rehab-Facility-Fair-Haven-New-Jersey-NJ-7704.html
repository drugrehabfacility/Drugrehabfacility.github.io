      One simply need to follow recommendations for a smooth detox. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.

      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction.
