      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab.

      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group.
