      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Cells in the kidneys move waste out of the body altogether. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.
