      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs.

      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care.

      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
