      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere.
