      This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. A lot of individuals wonder if this organization satisfies them. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance.
