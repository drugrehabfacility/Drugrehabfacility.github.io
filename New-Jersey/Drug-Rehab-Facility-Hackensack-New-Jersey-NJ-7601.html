      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. 
      And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality.
