      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
