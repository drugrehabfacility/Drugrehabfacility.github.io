      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. 
      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient.

      The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.

      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
