      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
