      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. 
      If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.Outpatient detoxification as safe and effective as inpatient detoxification for those with mild withdrawal benefits those with positive, supportive family circumstances or job situations can continue to work and maintain day-to-day activities with fewer disruptions greater social support opportunities than inpatient increased risk of relapse resulting due to easy access of drugs/alcohol less expensive less time consuming not appropriate for all patients; requires assessment retain greater freedom suitable for those with high motivation to complete detox Inpatient detoxification 24/7 medical support cases of heavy alcohol/drug dependence or chronic use cases of previous complications or intense symptoms of withdrawal higher cost may encourage unnecessary dependence on hospital staff more likely to complete detoxification process than outpatient suitable for suicidal or homicidal patients suitable for those at risk of potentially life-threatening complications of withdrawal suitable for those in adverse or disruptive family or job situations suitable for those not able to travel daily to a treatment facility suitable for those with severe or medically complicated withdrawal Being anxious about entering a detox treatment program is natural.

Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary.
