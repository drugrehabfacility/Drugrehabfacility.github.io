      Detox facilities in Washington combine medicine, holistic therapy and the best clinical staff in order to create a very comfortable and quick detox from drugs and alcohol. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again.
