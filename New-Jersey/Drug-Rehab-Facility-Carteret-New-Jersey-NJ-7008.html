      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      It might be worth checking your computer for viruses with an antivirus utility such as CureIt from «Dr. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      With a big smile and the huge love I've always had for you, I just want to say, I love you ... my darling daughter.
