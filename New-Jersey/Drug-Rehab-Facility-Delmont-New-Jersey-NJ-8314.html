      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard.

    <p>
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own.
