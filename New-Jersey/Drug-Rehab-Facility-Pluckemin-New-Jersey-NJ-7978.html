      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.

      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important.
