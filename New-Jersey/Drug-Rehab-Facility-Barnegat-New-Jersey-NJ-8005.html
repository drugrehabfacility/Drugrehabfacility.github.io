      The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
