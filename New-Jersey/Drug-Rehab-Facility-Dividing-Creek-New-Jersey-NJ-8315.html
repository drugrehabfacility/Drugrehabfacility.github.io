      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 2 percent of admissions to addiction treatment were for outpatient detox, 0. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again.
