      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      Each individual insurance plan is different, and insurance can greatly help to defray the potential costs.
