      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).

      This allows someone to not so much focus on what is missing in their detox facility in Washington but more so on the next steps needed for them to get sober and stay sober after their physical detox.
