      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat.

      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience.
