      Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option.
