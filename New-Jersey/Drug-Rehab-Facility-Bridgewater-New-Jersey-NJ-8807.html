      Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG.

      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work.

      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.
