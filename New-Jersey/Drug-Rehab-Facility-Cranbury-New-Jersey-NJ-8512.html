      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs.
