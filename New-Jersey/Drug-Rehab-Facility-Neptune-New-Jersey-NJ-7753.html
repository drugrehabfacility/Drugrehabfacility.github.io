If you are unable to start treatment at a detox or rehab center right away, you'll need to start our at home detox preparation program / detox after contacting Drug Rehab Advisor for inpatient programs. 
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.
