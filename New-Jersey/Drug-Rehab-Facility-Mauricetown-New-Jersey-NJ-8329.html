      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment. The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine.
