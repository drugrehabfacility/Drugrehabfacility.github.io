      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. 
      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs.
