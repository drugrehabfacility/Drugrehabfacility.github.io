      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox. Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body.

      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.

      The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment.We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance.
