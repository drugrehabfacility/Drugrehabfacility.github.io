      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through.

      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      Detox facilities all over the country are not created equal that is why detox facilities in Washington give one of the most comfortable and home like experiences for each client that needs to separate themselves from their drug use and drinking. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      They will admit an opiate user, but with the understanding that they will have to “tough out” the uncomfortable withdrawal.
