      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Let Sober Living Drug Rehab guide and assist you on the right route to a high quality treatment program for drug addiction.

But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life.
