      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step.
