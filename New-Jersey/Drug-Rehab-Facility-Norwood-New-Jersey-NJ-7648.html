      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
