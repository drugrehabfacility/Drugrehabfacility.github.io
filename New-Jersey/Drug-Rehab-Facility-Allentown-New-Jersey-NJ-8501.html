      Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end.

      The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink.

      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.
