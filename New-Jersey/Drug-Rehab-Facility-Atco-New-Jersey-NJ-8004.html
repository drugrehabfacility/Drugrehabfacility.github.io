      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      Approximately 98% of our patients travel to our center from all over the United States and the world.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face.
