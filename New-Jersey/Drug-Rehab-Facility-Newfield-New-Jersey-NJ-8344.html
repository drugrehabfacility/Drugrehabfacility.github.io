      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises.Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts.
