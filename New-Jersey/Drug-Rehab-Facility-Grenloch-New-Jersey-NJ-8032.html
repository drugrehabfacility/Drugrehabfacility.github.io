      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
