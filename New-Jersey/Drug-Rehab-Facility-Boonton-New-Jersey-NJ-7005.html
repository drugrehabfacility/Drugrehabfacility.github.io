      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. 
      Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers.
