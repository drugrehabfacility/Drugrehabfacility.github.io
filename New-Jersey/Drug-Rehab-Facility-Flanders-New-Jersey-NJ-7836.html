      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. These groups are most often free, requiring no dues.
