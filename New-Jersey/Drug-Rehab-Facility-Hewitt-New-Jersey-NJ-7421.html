      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. These include the Christian Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Centers and Harbor Light detox and residential centers, which can be found nationwide, as well as a variety of other rehab centers and organizations dedicated to residential rehabilitation and support based on their specific faith traditions. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine.
