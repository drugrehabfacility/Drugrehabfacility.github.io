      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.
