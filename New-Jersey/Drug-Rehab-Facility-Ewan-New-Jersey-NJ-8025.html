      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice.
