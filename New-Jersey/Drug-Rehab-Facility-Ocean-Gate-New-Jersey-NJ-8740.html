      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs.Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used.
