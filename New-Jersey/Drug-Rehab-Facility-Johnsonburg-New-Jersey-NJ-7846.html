      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
