      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs. 
      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. Search our directory or call 800-483-2193 to speak with a caring treatment specialist today! 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time.
