    </p>
    <p>
      Opiate detox centers specialize in helping patients who are addicted to opiates and can provide profound treatment measures to assist the recovering addict in their plight against opiate addiction. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
