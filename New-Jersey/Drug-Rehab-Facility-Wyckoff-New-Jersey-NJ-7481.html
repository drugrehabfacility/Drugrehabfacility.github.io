      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.
