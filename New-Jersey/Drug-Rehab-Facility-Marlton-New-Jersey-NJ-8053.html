      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms.

      Recovery </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
