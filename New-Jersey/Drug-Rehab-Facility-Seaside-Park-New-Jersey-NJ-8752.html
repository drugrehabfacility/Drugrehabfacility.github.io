      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse.
