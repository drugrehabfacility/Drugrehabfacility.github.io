      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest. Those executive level centers have been selected which meet and exceed expectations. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. 
      Outpatient medical detox used methadone and suboxone replacement therapies.
