      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction.
