      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor.

      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs.Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher.
