      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.

      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense.
