      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.

      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. Alcohol detox in Ohio can last as little as three or four days, or up to several weeks for those fighting a severe or long-term addiction. 
      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs.
