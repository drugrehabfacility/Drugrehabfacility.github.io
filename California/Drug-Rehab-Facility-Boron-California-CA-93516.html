      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.

      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
