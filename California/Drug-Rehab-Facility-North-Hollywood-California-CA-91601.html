      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. 
      You can also choose to take advantage of our in-home drug detox programs, which bring the benefits of our facilities to the comfort of your private residence. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy.

Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
