      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed.
