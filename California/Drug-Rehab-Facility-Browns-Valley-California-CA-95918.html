      At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects.
