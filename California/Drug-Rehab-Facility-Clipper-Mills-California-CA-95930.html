      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor.

      In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind.

After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins.
