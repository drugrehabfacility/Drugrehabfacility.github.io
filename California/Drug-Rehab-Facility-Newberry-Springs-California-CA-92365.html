      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.

      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.
