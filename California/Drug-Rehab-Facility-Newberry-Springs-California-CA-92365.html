      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Each one of these facilities has their own treatment style and philosophy. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7.
