      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important.

      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.In the various drug detoxification programs and alcohol detox treatments, the body is purged of the poisons accumulated in the body as a consequence of addiction. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally.
