      Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. 
      There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. 
      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      We then came up with a final ranking, and filtered out the very best for this list.
