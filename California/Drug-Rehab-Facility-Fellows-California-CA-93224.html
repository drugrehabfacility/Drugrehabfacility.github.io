      Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment. Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.

      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you.
