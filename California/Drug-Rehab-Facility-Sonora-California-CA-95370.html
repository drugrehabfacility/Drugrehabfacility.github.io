      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released.
