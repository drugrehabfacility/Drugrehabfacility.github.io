      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. 
      Originally founded as an orphanage for boys in 1916, Rosecrance has grown and evolved significantly, and now helps more than 13,000 people each year. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome.
