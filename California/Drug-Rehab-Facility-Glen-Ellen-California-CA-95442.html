Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.
