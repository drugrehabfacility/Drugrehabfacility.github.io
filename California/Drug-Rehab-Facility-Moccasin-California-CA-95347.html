      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
