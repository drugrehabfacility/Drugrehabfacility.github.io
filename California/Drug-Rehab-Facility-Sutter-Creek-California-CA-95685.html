      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. 
      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.
