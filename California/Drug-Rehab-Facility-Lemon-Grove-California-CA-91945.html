      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered.
