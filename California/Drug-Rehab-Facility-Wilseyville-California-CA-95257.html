      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction.
