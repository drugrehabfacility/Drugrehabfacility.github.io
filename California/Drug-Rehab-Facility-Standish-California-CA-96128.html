      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. 
      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be? Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.
