      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Those who get treated and then quit going to meetings since they believe they're " cured " almost always return to drinking eventually.
