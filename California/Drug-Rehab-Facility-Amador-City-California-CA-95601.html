      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. 
      All others are not considered regardless of media hype. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.
