      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
