      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. 
      During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
