      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision.
