      High Drug Use In Connecticut According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, Connecticut has one of the highest percentages for drug use in the United States. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible.

      Addiction Treatment is Pinnacle Medical Detox Staff In order to overcome a drug or alcohol addiction seeking out treatment from a drug detox center or treatment center is essential. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. 
      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago.
