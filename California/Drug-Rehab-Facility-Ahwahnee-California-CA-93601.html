    </h3>
    <p>
      If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.
