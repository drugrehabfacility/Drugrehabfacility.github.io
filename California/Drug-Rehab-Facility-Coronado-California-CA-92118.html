      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? 
      The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict.

      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids.
