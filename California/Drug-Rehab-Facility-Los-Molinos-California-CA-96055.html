      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Alcoholics Anonymous isn't an organization you can see a few occasions and consider yourself "cured." Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is among the very best treatment choices for a recovering alcoholic. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.

      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary.
