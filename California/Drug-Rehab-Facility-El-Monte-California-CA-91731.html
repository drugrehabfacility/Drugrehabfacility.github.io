      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Paying for Treatment Ultimately, paying for amphetamine rehab in Ohio is a matter of accessing available health insurance options or using your existing health plan. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
