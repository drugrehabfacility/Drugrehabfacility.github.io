      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
