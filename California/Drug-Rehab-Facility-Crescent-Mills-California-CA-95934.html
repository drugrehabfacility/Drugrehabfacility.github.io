      Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      For the person interested in history and heritage, Cincinnati’s culture was largely influenced by the large numbers of German and Irish immigrants who settled the area. For more information on this facility go to www.northlandmbs.com/ 8.

      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      If Roger Ebert was still alive, he would give Detox of South Florida two thumbs up! Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
