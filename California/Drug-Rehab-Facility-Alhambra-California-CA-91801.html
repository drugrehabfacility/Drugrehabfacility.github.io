      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. 
      Getting the right detox withdrawal advice should save you needless worry. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain.

      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves.
