      New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal.

      Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.

      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems.

      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay.
