      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function.
