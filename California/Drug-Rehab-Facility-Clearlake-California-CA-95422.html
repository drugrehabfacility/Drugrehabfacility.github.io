      The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. There are multiple reasons to choose detoxes in MA. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work.
