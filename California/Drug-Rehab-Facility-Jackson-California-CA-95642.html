      Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.
