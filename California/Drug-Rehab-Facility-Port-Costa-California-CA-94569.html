      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Quick drug detoxification allows us to clean the receptors completely. 
      1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. 
      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Do they accept private pay or offer payment plans or loans? While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
