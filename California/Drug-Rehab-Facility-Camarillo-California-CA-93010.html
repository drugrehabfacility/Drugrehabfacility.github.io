cocaine user. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE).
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. 
      Ohio rehab centers are gold standard centers for addiction treatments. 888-424-2626 A professional and courteous consultant will contact you. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
