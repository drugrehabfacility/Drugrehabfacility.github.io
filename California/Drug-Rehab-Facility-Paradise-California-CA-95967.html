      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.
