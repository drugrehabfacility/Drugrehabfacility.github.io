      Prescription Pain Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – This type of withdrawal is very similar to the withdrawal effects of heroin listed above. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
