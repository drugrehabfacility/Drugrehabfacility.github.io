      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost.
