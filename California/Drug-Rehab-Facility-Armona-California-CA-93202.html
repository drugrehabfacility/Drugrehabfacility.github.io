The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role.

      These individuals may not know that there are options for them. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful?Some of these dangers can include seizures and even death. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs.

      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.

      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective.
