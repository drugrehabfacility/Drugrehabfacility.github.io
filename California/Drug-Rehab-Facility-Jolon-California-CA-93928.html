      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. 
      Treatment Center Finder will connect you with the right Massachusetts rehab for you or your loved one. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.
