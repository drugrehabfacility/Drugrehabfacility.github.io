      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The people normally do want some kind of path to follow after they go away.
