      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox.
