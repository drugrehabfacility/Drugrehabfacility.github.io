      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      This is primarily for safety and security of the patient. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE!

      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given.
