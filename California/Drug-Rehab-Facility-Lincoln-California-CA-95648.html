      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.

Each individual insurance plan is different, and insurance can greatly help to defray the potential costs. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Do you want to get more exposure to people looking for your services in your city? 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem.
