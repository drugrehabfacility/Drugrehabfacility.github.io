      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety.
