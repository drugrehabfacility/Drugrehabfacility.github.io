      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! Vincent Depaul provide free treatment for those who qualify for help. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.

      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.
