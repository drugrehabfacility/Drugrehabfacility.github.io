      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Narcotics Anonymous: A 12-step support group program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem.

      Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.
