      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. These treatment centers also provide financial assistance programs to people in dire financial situations.Home Detox Centers Drug Detox Centers How Inpatient Drug Detox Works How Inpatient Drug Detox Works Inpatient drug detoxification functions through the hard work and dedication of doctors, nurses, counselors, and volunteers to help patients get through their withdrawal syndrome and end their dependence on drugs. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery.
