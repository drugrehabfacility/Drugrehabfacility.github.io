      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
