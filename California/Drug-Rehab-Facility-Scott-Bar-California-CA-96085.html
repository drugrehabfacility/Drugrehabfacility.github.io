      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. 
      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. Take the First Step to a Better Life You aren’t expected to have a clear plan for how to get from where you are now to where you want to be. 
      Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. 
      Partial hospitalization: This treatment program best applies to patients who require a continuous medical Fairview UT 84629 monitoring, but who are not very affected by the drug abuse problem.
