      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.

      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more.
