      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own.
