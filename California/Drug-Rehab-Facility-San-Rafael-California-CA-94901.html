      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. 
      If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab.
