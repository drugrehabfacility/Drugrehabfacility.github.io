      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility.

      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.

      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.

      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean.

      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Our treatment helpline will connect you with facilities in Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and West Haven as well as throughout all other areas of the state. 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others.If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.
