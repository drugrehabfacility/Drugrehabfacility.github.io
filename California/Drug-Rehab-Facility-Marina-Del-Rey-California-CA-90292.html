      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.

Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness.Combining natural medicine and care with traditional medicine can be the most effective detox methods. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.
