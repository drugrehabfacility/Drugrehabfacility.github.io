      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. 
      Get them the help they need so they can begin their journey to recovery today.
