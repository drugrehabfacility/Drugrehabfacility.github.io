      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. 
      When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.
