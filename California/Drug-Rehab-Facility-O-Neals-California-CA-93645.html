      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction. 
      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life.
