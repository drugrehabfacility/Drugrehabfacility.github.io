      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations.
