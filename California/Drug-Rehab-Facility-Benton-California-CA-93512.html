      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. After Detox Some individuals find it necessary to enroll in an after program after drug detox is completed to help you rebuild your life. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.
