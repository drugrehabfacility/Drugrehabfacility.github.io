      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services.

      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort.

      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription.

      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation). 
      Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body.

      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.
