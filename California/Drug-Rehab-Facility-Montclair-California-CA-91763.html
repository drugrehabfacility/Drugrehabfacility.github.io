      All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. 
      PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.

      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction.

      A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.

      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them.

      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.

      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live.
