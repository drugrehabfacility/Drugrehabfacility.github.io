      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      If you live outside of Ohio, seeking treatment in the Buckeye State can help you gain the fresh start needed to repair and rebuild your life after overcoming addiction.
