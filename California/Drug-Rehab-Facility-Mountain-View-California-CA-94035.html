      This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.
