      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety.

      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      If you're the type of person who thinks independently and expects excellent natural individualized rehab & detox programs that are successful, I've got something for you." All the benzo detox and rehab centers the Drug Rehab Advisor refers to deliver above standard levels of service and care. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term.
