      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. There are many explanations for why giving up alcohol needs a critical dedication. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.

      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction.
