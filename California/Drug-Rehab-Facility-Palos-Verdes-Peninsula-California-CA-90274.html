      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.
