      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment.The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
