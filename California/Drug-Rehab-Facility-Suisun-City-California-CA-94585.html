      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Drugs distributed into Chicago are intended not only for the resident market but also for states across the country. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward.
