      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. We specialize in recommending excellent Alcohol detox and Benzo detox centers to our callers. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. As a person begins to feel better, they can begin to take a more active part in the therapy part of rehab. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use.
