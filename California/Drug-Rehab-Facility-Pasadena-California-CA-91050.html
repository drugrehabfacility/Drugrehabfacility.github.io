Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. 
      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
