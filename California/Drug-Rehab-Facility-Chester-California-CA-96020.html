      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
