      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. 
      Call today and speak to a treatment counselor about rehabilitation. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
