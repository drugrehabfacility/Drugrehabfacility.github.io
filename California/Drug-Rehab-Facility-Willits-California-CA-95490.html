      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol.
