      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.

      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. Call Now (888) 365-2740 Questions about treatment?

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment.
