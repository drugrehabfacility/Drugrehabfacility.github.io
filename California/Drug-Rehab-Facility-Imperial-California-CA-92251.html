      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely.

      Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems.

      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.
