      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse.

      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox?
