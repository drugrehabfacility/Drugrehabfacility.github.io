      Let us help find a program that suits your needs. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving.

      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV.

      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Contact us today to find the right program for you or a loved one. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness.
