      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. A detox center providing the highest level of care will staff medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment providers that are all available to clients.

Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month.
