      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. Drug Withdrawal is the process of coming off of these drugs. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
