      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. 
      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. You don’t have to do it alone though, the drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer various forms of assistance to suit the different levels of addiction addicts may have experienced. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.

      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time.

      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded.We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs.

      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. This makes for a stunning backdrop and a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities.

      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated.The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body.People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.
