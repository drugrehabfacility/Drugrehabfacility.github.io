      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly.
