      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. 
      Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. For REHAB Center Descriptions and Pricing click this link.
