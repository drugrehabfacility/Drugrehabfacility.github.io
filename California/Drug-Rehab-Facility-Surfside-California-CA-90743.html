      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare.

      Can I get a private room during my stay in detox? Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.
