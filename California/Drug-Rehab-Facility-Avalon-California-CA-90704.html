      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley.
