Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams.
