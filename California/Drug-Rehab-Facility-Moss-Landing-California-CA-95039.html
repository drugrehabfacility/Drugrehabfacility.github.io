      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.

      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option.
