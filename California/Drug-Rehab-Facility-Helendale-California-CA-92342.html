      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal.
