      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings.
