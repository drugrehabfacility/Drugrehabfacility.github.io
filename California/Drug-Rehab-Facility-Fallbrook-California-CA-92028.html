      Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms – This includes symptoms such as seizures, extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, suicide, muscle aches, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, mood swings and many, many more. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms.
