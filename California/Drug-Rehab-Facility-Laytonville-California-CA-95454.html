      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. 
      You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs.
