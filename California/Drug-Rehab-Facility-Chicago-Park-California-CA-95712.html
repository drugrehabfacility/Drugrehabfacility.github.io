      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. 
      Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.
