      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. With rolling green hills to hike and have picnics on and beautiful lakes and rivers for fishing or kayaking, there’s no shortage of awesome outdoor activities to enjoy.  You can have fun living every day for a long, healthy and happy life. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs.
