      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone.
