      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being.
