As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere.

      As a person begins to feel better, they can begin to take a more active part in the therapy part of rehab. This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.
