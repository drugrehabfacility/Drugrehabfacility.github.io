      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Aftercare Services in Ohio Ohio has brought many great things to our country, not least of which is its dedication to helping those struggling with addiction.
