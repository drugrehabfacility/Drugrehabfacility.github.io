      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
