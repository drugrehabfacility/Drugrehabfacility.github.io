      We certainly do care about aesthetics and making our guests feel comfortable, but your treatment is our utmost priority. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions.

Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism.

      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun.
