      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear.

      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.

      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health.

      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.
