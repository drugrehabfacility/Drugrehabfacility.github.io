      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! Once under general anesthesia and deep sedation, the opiate antagonist is administered and also a strict formula of medications specifically designed to flush out the patients opiate receptors.

      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs.

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms – Unknown to some alcohol produces many withdrawal effects including delirium tremens (uncontrolled shaking), seizures, depression, anxiety, stomach aches, vomiting, restlessness and headaches. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction.
