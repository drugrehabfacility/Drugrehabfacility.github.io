      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
