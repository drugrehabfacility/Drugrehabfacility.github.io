      This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility.
