      Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
