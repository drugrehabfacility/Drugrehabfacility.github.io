      Narcotics Anonymous: A 12-step support group program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      On average, detox takes 5 days, but can range from 3 to 10 days. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. Our recommended integrative detox centers deliver more effective and sympathetic levels of care than Sierra Tucson, the Meadows or McLean Hospital to name a few.

      This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse.
