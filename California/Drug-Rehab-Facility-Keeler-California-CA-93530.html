      Preferred Family Healthcare, Quincy (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Otherwise known as “Recovery Resources,” the Quincy facility merged with Preferred Family Healthcare in July 2014. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
