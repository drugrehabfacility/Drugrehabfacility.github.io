      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Let us help you find the right #addiction treatment program. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed.
