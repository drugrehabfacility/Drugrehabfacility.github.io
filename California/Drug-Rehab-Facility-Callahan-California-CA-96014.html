      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      The treatment facilities and rehab programs in Massachusetts drug detox centers are outstanding but at the same time they are quite affordable. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
