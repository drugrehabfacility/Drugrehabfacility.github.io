      They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment. 
      Compare the results that are listed and if possible, have a personal chat with the ones you like best. Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.
