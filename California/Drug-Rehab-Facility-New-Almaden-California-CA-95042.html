      The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.

      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
