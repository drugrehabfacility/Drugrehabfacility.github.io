      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions.Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.

      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year.

In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab.
