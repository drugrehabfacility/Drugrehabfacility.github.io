      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.
