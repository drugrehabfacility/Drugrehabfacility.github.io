      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again.
