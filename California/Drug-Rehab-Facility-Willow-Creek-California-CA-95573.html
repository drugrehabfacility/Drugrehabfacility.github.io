[...If the patient lives in serbia, we provide the possibility of consultation where one will come to us and get free medical examination. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease.
