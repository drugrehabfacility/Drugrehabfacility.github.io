      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. 
      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain.
