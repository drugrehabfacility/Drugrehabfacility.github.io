      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
