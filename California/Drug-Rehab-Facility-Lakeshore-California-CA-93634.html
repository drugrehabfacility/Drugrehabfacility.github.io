    <p>
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. 
      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.

    <p>
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. 
      However, if you are like most individuals and families you want to find drug detox centers near me and you want to know what type of health insurance plan will cover treatments for your loved one. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction.
