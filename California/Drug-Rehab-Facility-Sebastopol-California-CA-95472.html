The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day.

      Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death.
