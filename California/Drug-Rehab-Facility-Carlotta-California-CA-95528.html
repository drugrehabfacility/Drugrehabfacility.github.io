      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      The goal is to help you get mentally and physically stable. The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. These are often part of larger public or community health agency networks within the government. 
      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction.
