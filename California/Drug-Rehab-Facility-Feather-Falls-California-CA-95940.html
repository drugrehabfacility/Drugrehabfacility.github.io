      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.August 23, 2017 by Mark Adams Learn More about the Available Miami Lakes Drug Detox Facilities Drug and alcohol addiction may seem like a simple, catch-all term for anyone who has a substance abuse problem but there are many intricacies to each individual’s fight with their dangerous and debilitating habit. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete.
