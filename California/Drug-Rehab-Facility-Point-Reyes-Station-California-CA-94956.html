      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Your doctor did not tell you how addictive benzos would be. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. A blockagge that does not allow the patient the possibility to return to drugs at all so patient is not interested in drugs anymore. 
      Smiling is considered infectious, so keep on smiling! Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).

      You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center.
