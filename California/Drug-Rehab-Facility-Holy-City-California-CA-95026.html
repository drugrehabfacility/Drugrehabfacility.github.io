      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers.
