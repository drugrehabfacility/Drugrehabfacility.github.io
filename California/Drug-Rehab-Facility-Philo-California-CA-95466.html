      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs.

      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available.
