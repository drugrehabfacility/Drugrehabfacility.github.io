Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

      A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms.The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.

      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body.

      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
