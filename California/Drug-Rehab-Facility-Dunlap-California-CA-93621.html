      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. 
      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Together, the pair of you can work through a list of Massachusetts detox centers and select the program that matches your goals, needs, and finances.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.
