      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.
