      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery.

      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery.

      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics.
