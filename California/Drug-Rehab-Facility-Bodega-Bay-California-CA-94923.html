      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
