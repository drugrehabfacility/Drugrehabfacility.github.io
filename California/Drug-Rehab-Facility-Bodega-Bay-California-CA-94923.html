      Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      All care providers should be appropriately licensed and credentialed. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities.

      I've dedicated my life to helping others gain health and happiness. Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. 
      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths.

      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Correct healthy detox & withdrawal programs ensures that detox is wonderfully successful and healthy. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Internet gives you ample opportunities to compare prices and location of the various centers in and around Chicago; make the most of the opportunity to choose a program.
