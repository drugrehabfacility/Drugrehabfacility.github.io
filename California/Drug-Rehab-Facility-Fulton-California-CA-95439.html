We provide the best, most economical and efficient treatment possible for all who need our care. * Inpatient medical detoxing * Residential drug rehab * Outpatient rehabilitation * Subsequent alcohol and drug dependency treatment The most important first step to healing is cleansing from the compound. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".

      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs.Natural Drug Detox Programs Naturally overcoming physical drug dependence is another method of detox that can be very effective and liberating at the same time. 
      We make the most effective, affordable, top-rated drug detox facilities available to help you beat addiction. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox.
