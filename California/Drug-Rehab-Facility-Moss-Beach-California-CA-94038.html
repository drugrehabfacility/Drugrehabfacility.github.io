      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. 
      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox.In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. This allows someone to not so much focus on what is missing in their detox facility in Washington but more so on the next steps needed for them to get sober and stay sober after their physical detox.
