      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful?
