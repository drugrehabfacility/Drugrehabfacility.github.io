      Addiction Treatment is Pinnacle Medical Detox Staff In order to overcome a drug or alcohol addiction seeking out treatment from a drug detox center or treatment center is essential. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.

      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! 
      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.
