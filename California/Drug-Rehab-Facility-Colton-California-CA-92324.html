      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs.

      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms.
