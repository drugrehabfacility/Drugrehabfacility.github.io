      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. 
      Medical detox is available through high quality drug detox centers under the supervision of medical professionals. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      These scholarships are often offered through private treatment facilities or through organizations concerned with helping those who are struggling with addiction.
