      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year.
