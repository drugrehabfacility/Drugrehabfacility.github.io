      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. Counseling is a good idea for your full therapeutic of the individual. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal.
