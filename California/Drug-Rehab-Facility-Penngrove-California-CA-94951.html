      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone.
