      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.
