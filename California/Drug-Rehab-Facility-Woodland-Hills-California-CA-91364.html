      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      A detox center providing the highest level of care will staff medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment providers that are all available to clients. A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.
