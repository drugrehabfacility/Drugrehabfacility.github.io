      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. 
      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation.
    </p>

      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. Counseling is a good idea for your full therapeutic of the individual.
