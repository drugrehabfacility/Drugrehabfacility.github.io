      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. 
      A growing number of drug treatment centers in Connecticut have services for the hearing impaired. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members.

      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step.

Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7.
