      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms.
