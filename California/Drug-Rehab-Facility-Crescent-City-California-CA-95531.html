      More than 10% of all heroin overdose deaths that occurred in the U. Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Let Sober Living Drug Rehab guide and assist you on the right route to a high quality treatment program for drug addiction. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.
