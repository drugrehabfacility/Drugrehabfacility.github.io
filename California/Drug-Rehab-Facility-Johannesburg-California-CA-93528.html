      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. 
      Drug rehabilitation involves the following types of behavioral therapy; Cognitive behavioral therapy: helps patients know, avoid and bear with situations which may make them return to their addiction habits. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. 
      Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment.
