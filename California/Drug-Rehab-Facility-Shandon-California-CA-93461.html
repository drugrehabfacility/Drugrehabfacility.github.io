      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation.

      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment.
