      Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused.

      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program.
