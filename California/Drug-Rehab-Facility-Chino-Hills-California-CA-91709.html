      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Beckett Springs, Beckett Ridge (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Beckett Springs is a 48-bed behavioral hospital that offers outpatient and inpatient mental health and addiction treatment for adults and their families. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
