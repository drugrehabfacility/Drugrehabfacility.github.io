      Make the call and get him or her the help needed today. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.
