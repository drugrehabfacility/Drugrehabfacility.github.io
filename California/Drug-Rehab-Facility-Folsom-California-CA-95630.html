      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s.

      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances.I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.
