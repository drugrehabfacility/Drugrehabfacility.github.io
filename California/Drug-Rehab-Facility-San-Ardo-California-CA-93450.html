      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse.

      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.
