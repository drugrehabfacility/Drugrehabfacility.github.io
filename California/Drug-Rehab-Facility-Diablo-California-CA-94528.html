      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal.

      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.
