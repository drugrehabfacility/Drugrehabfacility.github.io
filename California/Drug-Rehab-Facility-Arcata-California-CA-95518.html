      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises.

      Ohio detox centers understand how difficult it can be to overcome addiction, and will guide you safely through detox and withdrawal with a lowered risk for health complications.
