      Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. 
      How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? 5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days.

      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live.
