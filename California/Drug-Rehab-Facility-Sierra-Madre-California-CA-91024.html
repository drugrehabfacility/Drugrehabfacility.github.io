      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. 
      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given.
