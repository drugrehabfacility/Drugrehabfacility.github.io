      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. This allows the staff and the client to truly relate and get some really positive feedback and what steps need to be taken after detox to remain sober. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
