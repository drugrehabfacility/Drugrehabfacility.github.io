      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence.
