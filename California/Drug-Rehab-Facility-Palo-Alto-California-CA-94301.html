      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.

      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program. The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. 
      When you are considering a facility for drug detox in Connecticut, consider a service that will not only be safe and effective but will also keep you comfortable.
