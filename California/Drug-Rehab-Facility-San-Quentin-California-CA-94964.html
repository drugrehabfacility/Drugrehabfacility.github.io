      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. On average, detox takes 5 days, but can range from 3 to 10 days. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. 
      Whether you are looking for a drug detox in Boston or any other area, we can help.
