      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Each one of these facilities has their own treatment style and philosophy. 
      You’ll enjoy comfortable furnishings and warm décor in soothing settings.
