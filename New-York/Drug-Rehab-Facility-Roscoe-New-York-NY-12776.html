      Alcoholics do not understand that they're going to become an individual, and don't the folks. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
