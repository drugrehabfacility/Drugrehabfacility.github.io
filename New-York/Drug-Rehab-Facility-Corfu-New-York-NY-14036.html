      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.

The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.

Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused.For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.

      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
