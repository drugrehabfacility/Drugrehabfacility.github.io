      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.
