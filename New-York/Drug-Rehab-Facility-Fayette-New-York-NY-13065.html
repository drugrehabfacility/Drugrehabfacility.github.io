      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
