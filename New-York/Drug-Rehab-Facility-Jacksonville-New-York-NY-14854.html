It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step.
