      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming.
