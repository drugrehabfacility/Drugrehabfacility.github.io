      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      RehabCenter.net offers free information about Ohio’s residential rehab programs.
