    <p>
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      We are making you a brand new one that isnâ€™t broken, with pickles! The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. All provided by a counseling service that works 24 hours a day that can give you an early appointment or schedule a medical visit if that is what you require by the time you call them up. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process.

      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Our in-house program allows the medical team to begin working to improve your life in a drug-free environment. Stays may be as short as 7 days costing $15,000 and up. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox.
