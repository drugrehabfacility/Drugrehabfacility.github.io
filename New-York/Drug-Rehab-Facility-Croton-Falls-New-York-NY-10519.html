      We are standing by to offer assistance, to provide information about drug rehab here in Pearl Harbor HI and answers to your alcohol addiction treatment questions. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation.

      I am happy to be here and I know anyone that comes here will be happy too.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. We certainly do care about aesthetics and making our guests feel comfortable, but your treatment is our utmost priority. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs.

      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program.
