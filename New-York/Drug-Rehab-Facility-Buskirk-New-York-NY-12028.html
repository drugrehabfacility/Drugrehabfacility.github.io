      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.

      The medication will help the person hen and hours of withdrawal symptoms. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.

      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      After the individual continuously use heroin a tremendous negative effects may come up. 
      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days.
