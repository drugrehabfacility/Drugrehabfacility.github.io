      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.

      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription.
