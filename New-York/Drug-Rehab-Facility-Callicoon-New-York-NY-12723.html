      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
