      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction.
