      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center.
