    <p>
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. Nevada is an anomaly when it comes to drug detox center admissions, though. 
      They are scattered through the length and breadth of Illinois. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse.
