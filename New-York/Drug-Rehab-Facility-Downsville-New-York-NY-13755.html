      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.

These treatment centers also provide financial assistance programs to people in dire financial situations.Testimonial – I spent hours trying to find treatment for my drug problem; I am duel-diagnosed and couldn’t find anybody to help me with my care needs. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
