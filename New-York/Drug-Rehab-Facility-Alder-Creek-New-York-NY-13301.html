      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative.
