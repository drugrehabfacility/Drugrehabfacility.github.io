      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.

      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.
