      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity.
