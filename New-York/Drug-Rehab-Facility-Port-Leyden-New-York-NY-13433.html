      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.

Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.

      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
