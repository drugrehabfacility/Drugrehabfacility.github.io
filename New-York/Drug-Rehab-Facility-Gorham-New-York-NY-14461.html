      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
