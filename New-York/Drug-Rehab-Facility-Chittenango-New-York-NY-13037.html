      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers.

      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare.

      All provided by a counseling service that works 24 hours a day that can give you an early appointment or schedule a medical visit if that is what you require by the time you call them up. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab.
