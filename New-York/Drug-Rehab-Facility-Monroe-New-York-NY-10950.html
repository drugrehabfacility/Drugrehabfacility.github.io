      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option.
