      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.
