      A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Please tell Kathy she is great, and made a big difference for me.

      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip. 
      This allows the staff and the client to truly relate and get some really positive feedback and what steps need to be taken after detox to remain sober.
