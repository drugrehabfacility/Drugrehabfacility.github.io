      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. 
      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown.
