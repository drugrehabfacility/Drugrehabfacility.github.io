      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction.

      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
