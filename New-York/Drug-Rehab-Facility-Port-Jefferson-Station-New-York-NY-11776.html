      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs.
