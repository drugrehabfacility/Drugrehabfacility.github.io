      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.

      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love.
