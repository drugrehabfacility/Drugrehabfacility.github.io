      Illinois & Drug Abuse Alcoholism is a sneaky illness. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too.
