      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient.

      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question.
