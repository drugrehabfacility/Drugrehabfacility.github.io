    <p>
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
