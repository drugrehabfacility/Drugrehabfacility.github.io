      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. 
      Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.
