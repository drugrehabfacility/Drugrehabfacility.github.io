      If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs.
