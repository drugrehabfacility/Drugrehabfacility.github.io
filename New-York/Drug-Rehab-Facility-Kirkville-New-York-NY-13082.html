      Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. 
      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question.
