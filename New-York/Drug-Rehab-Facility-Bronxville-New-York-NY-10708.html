      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one.

      Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms – This includes symptoms such as seizures, extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, suicide, muscle aches, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, mood swings and many, many more. Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.
