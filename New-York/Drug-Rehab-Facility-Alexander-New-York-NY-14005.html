      The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. At Addiction Detox Centers, a full restorative evaluation will be conducted to determine what program best fits their need based on particular drug usage and habits. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
