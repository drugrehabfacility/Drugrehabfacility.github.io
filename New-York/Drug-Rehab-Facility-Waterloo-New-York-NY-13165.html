      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
