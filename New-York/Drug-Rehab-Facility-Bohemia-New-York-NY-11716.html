      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.

Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
