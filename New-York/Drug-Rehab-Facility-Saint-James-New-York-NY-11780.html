      Opiate Detox Centers One of the most dangerous and most addictive classes of drugs available today is the opiate. 6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. Cocaine and methamphetamine users can almosr always safely withdraw in a non-medical detox center in Connecticut. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.
