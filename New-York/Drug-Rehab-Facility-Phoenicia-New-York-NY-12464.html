      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.
