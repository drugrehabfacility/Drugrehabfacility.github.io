    <p>
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. After Detox Some individuals find it necessary to enroll in an after program after drug detox is completed to help you rebuild your life. 
      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox.
