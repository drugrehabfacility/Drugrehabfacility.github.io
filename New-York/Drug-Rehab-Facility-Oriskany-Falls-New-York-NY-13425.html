      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Like vomiting, irritation, nausea, nostril, chill. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
