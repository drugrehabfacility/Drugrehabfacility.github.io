      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.

      We provide a means to achieve physical, mental and emotional healing. Inpatient Rehab Centers in Ohio Offer Your Best Chance at Recovery from Addiction To meet the crisis of higher rates of substance abuse, Ohio’s inpatient rehab centers offer the latest rehabilitation science techniques and therapies. 
      Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process!
