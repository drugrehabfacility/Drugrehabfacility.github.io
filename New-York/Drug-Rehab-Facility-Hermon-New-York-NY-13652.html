      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance.

      Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. 
      From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
