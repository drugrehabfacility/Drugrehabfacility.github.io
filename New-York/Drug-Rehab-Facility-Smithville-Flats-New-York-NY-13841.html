Multi-dimensional family therapy: is specially meant to help addicts recover through the support of their families. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs.
