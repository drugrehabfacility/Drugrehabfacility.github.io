      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.

      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Drug Detox Drug detoxification or drug detox is used to reduce primarily the withdrawal symptoms in an individual addicted to drugs. Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using.
