      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      This is primarily for safety and security of the patient. Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. 
      Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years.
