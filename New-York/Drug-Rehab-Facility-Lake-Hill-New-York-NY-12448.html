      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 2 percent of admissions to addiction treatment were for outpatient detox, 0. 
      You don’t have to do it alone though, the drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer various forms of assistance to suit the different levels of addiction addicts may have experienced. Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab.

      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Free rehab centers and public assistance for rehab do exist. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms.
