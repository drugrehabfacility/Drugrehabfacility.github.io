      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. 
      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober?

      The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs.
