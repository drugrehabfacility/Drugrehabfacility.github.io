Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.

      Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation).
