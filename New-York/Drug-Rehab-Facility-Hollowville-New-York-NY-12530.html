      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs.
