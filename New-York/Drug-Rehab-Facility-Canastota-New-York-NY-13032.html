      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
