      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      We are here 24 hours a day to answer your questions.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. Get them the help they need so they can begin their journey to recovery today. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility.
