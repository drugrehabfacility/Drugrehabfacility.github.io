      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance.
