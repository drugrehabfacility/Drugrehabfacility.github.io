      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting.

      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse.
