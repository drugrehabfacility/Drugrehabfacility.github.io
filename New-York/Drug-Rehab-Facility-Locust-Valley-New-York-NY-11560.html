      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. Practicing kindness is as simple as helping the someone take groceries to the car.

Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug.
