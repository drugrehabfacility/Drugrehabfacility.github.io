      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality.

      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.

      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.
