      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.
