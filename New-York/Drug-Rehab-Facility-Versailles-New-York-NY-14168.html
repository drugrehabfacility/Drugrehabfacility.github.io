      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
