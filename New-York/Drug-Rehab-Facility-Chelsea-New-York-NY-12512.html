      Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority.
