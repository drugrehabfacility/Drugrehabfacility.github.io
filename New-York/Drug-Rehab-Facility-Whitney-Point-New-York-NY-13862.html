      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more.
