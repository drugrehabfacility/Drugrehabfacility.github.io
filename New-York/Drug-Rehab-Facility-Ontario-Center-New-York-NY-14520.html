If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story.
