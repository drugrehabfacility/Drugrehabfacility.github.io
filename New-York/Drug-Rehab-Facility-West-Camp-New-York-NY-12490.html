      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing.
