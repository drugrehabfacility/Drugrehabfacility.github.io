      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs.
