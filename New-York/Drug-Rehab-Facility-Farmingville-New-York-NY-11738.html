      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. 
      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. 
      Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.

      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.
