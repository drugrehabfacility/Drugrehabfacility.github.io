      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control.
