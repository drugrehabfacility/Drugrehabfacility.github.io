      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      You’ll find luxury beds, delicious food, and staff support around the clock. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone.
