      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible.

      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause.
