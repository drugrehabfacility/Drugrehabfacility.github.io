      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief.
