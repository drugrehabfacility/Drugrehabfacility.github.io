      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction. The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      Our advisors are on call to answer any questions on the costs of detox facilities and addiction treatment programs in Connecticut, CT, including coverage for private healthcare and medical insurance.

      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative.

      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
