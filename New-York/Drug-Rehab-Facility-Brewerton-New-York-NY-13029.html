      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.

      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.

      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use.
