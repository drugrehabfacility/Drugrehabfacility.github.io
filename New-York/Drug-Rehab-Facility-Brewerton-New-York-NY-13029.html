      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. 
      Ohio is one of the five national states with the highest rate of overdose deaths. At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

      When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.

      Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug.
