      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms – This includes symptoms such as seizures, extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, suicide, muscle aches, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, mood swings and many, many more. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions.
