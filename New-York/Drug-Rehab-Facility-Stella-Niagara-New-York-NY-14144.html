      G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 - OR - Request a Callback G&G Holistic Addiction Treatment Program is a nationally recognized drug and alcohol rehab and treatment center with a comprehensive and integrated Mind-Body-Spirit approach to the treatment of addictions and co-occurring disorders. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
