      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. 
      You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.

      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
