Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.
