      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.

      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try.
