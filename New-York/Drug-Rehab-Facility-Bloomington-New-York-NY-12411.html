      Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question.

      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.
