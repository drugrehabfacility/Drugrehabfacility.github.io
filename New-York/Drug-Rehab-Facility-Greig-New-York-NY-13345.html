      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. Drug Detox may be achieved without the use of medications, in some cases drugs may be prescribed or administered to ease the withdraw symptoms. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.

      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Massachusetts; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now.When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given.
