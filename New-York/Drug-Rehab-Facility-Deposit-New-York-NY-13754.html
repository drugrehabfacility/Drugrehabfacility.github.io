      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      These centers also attain to excellent standards of integrated detox and rehab services for their clients. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. It is completely your responsibility to seek out the help.
