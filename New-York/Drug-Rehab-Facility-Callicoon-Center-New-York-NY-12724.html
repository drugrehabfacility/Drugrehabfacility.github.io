      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.

In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery.
