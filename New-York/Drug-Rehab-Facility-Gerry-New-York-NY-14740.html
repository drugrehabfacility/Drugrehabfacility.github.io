      In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

    <p>
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Drug detox, UROD, ibogaine therapy, naltrexone implant, anti drug craving treatment, oxyven, xenon gas, blood detoxification, plasmapheresis , lymphatic drainage... 
      Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment?
