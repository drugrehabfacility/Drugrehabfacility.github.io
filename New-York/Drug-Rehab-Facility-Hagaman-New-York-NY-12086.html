      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. The treatment facilities and rehab programs in Massachusetts drug detox centers are outstanding but at the same time they are quite affordable. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with.

      These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. To them, everyone should already know the dangers of drugs and that, if you use them, you are a character of low morality and willpower whose principles need a lot of work. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. 
      At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program.
