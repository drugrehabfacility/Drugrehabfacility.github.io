      Treatment For Drug Detox </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process.

      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately.

      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
