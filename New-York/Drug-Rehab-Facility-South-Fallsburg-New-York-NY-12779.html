      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs.

      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. 
      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones.
