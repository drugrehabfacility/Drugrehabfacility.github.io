      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs.

      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Use the search tool on this page to see the options you have here in Illinois. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.
