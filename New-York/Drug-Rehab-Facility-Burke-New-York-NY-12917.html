      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      Rutherford, New Jersey Alcohol and Drug Detox: Your One-Stop Detox and Rehab Facility Most rehabilitation centers today require an addict to undergo a detoxification process elsewhere before enrollment into their rehab programs.

As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Connecticut, CT offers some of the best detoxification centers and facilities for drug and alcohol withdrawal from substance abuse. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case.

      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.
