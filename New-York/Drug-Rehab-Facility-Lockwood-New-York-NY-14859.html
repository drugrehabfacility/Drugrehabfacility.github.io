      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. 
      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. 31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.
