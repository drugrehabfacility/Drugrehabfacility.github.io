      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.

      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE).
