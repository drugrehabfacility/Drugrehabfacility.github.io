      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. 
      The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.
