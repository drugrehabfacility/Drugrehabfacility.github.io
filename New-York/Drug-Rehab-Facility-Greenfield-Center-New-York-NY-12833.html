      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them.

      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.

      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects.
