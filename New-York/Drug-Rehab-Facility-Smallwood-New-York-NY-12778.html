      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Health insurance companies also can help you locate a good rehab center. As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.Along with this, emotional and psychological support is provided to the victims. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions. 
      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.
