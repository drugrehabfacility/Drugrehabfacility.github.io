      To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. 
      Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment.
