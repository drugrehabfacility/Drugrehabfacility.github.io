      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.

      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. If you need a snack, you can visit the cafe-style dining area. 
      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete.
