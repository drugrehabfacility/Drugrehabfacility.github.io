      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      Support to help you remain mentally focused on your recovery. Compare the results that are listed and if possible, have a personal chat with the ones you like best. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2.
