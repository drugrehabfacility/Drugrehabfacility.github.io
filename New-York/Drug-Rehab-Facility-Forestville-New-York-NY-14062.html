      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs.
