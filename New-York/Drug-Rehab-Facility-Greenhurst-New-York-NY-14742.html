      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox.
