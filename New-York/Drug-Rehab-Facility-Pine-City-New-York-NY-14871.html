      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. If a patient belongs to a particular religious philosophy then it is possible to find rehab centers in Ohio that are affiliated to that religion. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need.
