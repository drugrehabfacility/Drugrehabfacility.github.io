      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. Stays may be as short as 7 days costing $15,000 and up. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
