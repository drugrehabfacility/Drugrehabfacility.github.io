Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
