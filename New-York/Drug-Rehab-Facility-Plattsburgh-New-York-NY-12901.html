      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.

      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another.
