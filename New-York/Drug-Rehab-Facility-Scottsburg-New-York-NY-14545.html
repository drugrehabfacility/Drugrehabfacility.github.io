      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? 
      A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Serene Setting Panoramic windows, abundant natural light, and a soothing color palette promote well-being. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts.
