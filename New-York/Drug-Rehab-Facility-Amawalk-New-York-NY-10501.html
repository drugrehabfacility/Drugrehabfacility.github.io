      All of those who are involved directly with the recovering addict will also benefit from their attendance in a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Excellent detox which rejuvenates life is essential to make significant gains in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. 
      Narcotics Anonymous: A 12-step support group program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol.
