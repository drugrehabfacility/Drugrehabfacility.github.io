      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. 
      A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery.

      This makes for a stunning backdrop and a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Our drug addiction specialists are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! 
      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question.The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians.

      The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction.
