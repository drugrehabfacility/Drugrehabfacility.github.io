    <p>
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Detox facilities all over the country are not created equal that is why detox facilities in Washington give one of the most comfortable and home like experiences for each client that needs to separate themselves from their drug use and drinking. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs.

One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
