      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them.
