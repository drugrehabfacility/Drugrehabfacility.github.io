      Cincinnati actually boasts the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany with all types of cultural booths, exhibits, traditional attire, and delectable German delicacies to dine upon. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately.

      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
