      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. Simply put, the treatment program uses different disciplines with planning and purpose. 
      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
