      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. 
      These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area.
