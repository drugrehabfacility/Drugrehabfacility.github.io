      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.

      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
