      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland.

You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams.

      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given.

      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use.

      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process.

    <p>
      Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. 
      The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Further, in the report, it was also mentioned with the increase in the number of Massachusetts detox centers, number of people admitted to these facilities also increased to around 36,815.
