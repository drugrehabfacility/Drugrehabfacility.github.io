      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Friends and family: The loved ones of those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol often want to help but aren’t always sure how to bring it up. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses.

      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable.
