      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. 
      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
