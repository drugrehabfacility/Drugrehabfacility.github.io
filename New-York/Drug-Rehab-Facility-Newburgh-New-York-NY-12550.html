      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
