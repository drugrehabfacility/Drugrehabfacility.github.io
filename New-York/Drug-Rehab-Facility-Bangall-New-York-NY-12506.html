      Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. 
      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.
