      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery! 
      There are also other types of programs available that incorporate many modalities to achieving sober success for a lifetime.Inpatient vs. outpatient drug detox programs 640 320 How do you choose between an inpatient or outpatient drug detox program?

      Our programs for drug withdrawal in Howell offers the best possible care to all of our patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7.
