      Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.

It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.
