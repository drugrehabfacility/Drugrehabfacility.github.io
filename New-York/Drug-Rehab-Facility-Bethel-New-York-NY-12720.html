      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. The rehabilitation process has many phases and for someone to have a successful recovery, it is important for them to work hard and be committed during each section of this important and personal course of action.  Once a person decides they need help and wants to make an effort to get clean and sober, anyone in the area looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities can call Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center at (877) 855-3470 and talk to an addiction counselor to hear about all of the available programs.  Searching for rehab facilities and other care centers, including a Miami drug detox, can be a daunting process, but the highly trained professionals at Fort Myers White Sands will answer any questions you may have about your available options. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.
