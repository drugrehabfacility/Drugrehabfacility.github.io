      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering.Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
