      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. 
      Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs?
