      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. Simply put, the treatment program uses different disciplines with planning and purpose.
