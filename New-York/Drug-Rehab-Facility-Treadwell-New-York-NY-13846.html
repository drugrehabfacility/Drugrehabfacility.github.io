Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland.

      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
