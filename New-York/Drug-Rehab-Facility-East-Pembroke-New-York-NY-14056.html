      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      Medical Detox Centers Many hospitals and residential treatment facilities provide medical detox centers as part of their overall treatment regimen. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol.
