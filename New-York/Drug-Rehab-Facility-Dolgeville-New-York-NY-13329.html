      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge.

Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective.
