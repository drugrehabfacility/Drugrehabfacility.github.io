      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. AUD is the name doctors give to the range of issues people have with drinking. 
      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it.

      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program.
