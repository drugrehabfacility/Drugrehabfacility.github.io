      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
