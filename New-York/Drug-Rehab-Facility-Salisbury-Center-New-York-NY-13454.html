      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. 
      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
