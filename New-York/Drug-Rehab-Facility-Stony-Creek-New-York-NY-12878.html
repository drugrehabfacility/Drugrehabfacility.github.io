The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong.People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check.
