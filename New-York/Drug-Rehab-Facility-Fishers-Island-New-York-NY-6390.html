      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. The particular Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois even offers this medication regarding Clonidine as well as Naltrexone through the detox procedure.
