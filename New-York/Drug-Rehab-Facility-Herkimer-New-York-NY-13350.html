      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
