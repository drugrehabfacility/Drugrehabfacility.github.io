      Motivational incentives: it makes use of positive things meant to encourage the patient to abstain from addictive substances. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. In some cases, withdrawl can put your life at risk. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try.
