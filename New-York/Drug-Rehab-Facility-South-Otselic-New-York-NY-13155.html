      Originally founded as an orphanage for boys in 1916, Rosecrance has grown and evolved significantly, and now helps more than 13,000 people each year. Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. 
      In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance.

      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.

      Medical monitoring –Detox patients rest in well-furnished private rooms outfitted with monitoring equipment. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it.
