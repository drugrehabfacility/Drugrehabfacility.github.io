      It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. 
      Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. For more information on rehabilitation and the detox process, contact us today. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
