      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage.

      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.

      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink.

      Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition.A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.

      Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons.
