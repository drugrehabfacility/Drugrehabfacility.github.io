      You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. If you're the type of person who thinks independently and expects excellent natural individualized rehab & detox programs that are successful, I've got something for you." All the benzo detox and rehab centers the Drug Rehab Advisor refers to deliver above standard levels of service and care.

      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
