      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment?
