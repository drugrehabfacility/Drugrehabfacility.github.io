      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more.

      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely.

      When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse.
