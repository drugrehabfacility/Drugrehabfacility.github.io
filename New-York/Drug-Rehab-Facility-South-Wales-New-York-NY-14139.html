      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
