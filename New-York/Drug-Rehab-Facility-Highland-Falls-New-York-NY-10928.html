      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. For medical detox help, contact Drug Rehab Centers Putnam at (860) 207-8362. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life.
