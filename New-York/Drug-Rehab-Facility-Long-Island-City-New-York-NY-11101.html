      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.

      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?!
