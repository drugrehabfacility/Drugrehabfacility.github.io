      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. 
      For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.
