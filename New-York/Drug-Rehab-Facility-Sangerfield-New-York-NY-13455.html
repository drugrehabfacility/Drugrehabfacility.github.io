      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. Call now to speak with a caring treatment specialist. 
      Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery.
