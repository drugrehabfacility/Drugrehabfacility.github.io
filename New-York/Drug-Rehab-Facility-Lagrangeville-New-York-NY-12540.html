      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal.
