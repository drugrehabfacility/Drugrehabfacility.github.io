      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.
