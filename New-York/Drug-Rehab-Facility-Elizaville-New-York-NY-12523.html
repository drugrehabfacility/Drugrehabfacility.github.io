      Your doctor did not tell you how addictive benzos would be. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.
