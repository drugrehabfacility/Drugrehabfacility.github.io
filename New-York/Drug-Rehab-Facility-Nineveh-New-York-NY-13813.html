      I am grateful for this facility and hope anyone in need of detox chooses this place. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470.
