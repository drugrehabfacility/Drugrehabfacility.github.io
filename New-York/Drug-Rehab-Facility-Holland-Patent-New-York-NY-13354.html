      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.
