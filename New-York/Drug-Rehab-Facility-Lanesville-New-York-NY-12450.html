      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Heroin use in Ohio is also higher than national averages. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center?

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse.
