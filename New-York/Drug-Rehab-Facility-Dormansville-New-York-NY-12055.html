      When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. 
      Our in-house program allows the medical team to begin working to improve your life in a drug-free environment. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Make the call and get him or her the help needed today. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery.

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery.
