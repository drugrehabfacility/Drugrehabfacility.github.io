      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.

      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient.
