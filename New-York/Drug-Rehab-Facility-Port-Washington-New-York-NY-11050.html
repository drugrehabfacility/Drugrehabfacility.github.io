      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      Medication Assisted Detox - Drug Detox Centers Medication assisted detox is a common form of drug detox. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. It is always advisable to inquire about scholarships or grants available for low-income individuals when seeking a treatment center. 
      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. 
      These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction.

Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.
