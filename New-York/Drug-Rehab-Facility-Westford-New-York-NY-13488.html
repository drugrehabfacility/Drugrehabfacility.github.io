      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.

      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).
