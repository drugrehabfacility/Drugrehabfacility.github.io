      About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite.
