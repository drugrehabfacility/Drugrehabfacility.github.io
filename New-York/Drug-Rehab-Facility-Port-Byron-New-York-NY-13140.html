      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment.
