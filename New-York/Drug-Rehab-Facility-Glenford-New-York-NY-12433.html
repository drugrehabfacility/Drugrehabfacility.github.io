      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
