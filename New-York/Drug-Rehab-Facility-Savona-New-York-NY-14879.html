      An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others.

      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment.

      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance.

In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.
