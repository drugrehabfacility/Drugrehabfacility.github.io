      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.
