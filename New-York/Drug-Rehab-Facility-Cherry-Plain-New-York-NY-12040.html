      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body.

      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Some of the most common types of detox centers are outlined below: Inpatient Detox Centers These facilities provide the highest level of medical monitoring and supervision of all the other types of detox centers. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone.
