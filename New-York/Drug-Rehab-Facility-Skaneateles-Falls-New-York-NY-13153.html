      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. 
      There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center.
