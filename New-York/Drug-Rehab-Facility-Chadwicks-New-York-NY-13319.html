      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely.
