      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs. More Testimonials Here Need Help With Drugs or Alcohol?
