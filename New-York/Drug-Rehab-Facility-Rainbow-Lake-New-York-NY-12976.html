      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.
