      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.
