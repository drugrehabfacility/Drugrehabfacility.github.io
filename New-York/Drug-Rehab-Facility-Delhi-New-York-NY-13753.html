      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.

It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away.
