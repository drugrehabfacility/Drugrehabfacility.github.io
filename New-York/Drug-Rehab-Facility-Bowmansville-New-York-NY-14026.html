      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
