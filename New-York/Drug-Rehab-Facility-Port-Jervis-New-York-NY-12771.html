      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Holistic program options are also available in Ohio. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
