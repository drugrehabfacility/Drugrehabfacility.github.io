      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction.

      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. 
      Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone.
