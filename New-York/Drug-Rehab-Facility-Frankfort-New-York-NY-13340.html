Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. 
      Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day.
