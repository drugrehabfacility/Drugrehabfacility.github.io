      All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. 
      Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs. Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program.
