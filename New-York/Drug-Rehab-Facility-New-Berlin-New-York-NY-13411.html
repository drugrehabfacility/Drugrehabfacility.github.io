      For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms.

      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.
