      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.
