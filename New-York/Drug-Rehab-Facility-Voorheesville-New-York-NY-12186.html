We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Holistic program options are also available in Ohio.
