People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority.
