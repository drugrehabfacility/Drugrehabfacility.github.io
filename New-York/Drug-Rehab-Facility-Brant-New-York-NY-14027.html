      The alcoholic has lost the selection of will in regards to drinking. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. 
      An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process.After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.

      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction.
