      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.
