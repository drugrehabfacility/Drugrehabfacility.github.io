      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. 
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them.
