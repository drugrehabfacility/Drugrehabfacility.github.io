      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort. Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment.

      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Dublin Springs, Dublin (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Dublin Springs is an inpatient and outpatient mental health and addiction treatment facility. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).

      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse.
