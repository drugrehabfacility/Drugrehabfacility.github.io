      It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
