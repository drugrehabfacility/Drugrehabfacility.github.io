      Here at United Drug Rehab Group, our wide network of specialists run a detox program that not only accommodates to the physical and emotional needs of our guest, but has also been proven to have a high recovery rate. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
