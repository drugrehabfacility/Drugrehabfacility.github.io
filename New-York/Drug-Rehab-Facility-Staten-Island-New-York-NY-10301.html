      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. What worked for me were the awesome social activities and the involvement of my instructor. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.
