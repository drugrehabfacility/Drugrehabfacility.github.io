      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction. Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
