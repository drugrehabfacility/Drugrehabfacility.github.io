      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. 
      If you are skeptical of their success, you need only to head over to their Facebook page, where thousands of former clients and members of the community come together.

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment.

      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. To them, everyone should already know the dangers of drugs and that, if you use them, you are a character of low morality and willpower whose principles need a lot of work. 
      Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use.
