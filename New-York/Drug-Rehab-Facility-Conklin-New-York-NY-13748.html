      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. Counselors are available by both email and telephone. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery.
