      Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. Chiropractors,Acupuncture,Pediatricians 59 E Green St, Winterset, IA 50273 Health Trust Physicians Clinic , 2 reviews. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
