      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.
