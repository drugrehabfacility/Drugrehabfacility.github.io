      You should ask whether the group has a telephone listing. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals.
