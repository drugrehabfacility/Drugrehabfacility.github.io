      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.
