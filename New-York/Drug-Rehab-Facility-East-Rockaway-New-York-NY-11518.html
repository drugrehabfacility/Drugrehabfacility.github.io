      We specialise in helping you find inpatient and outpatient detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT with treatment programs for substance abuse. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.

      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose.
