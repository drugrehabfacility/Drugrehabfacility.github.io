It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs.

      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts.
