      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community.
