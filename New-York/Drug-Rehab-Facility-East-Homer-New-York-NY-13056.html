      For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      Through intensive individual therapy, group therapy, educational seminars and other healing techniques you to overcome past issues. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      There are scheduled daily activities, including group therapy and meetings, which are specifically designed to give our guests a huge support system while going through drug or alcohol detox. Wow what a difference it makes focusing on the positive part of everything instead of the negative. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. 
      A strong drugs dependency is one of the medication diseases and requirements specialists. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
