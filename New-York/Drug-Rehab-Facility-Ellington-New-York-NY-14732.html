      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      The length of stay for detox can vary, the above is a general guide, so please contact Sunrise Detox directly to learn more about what specific needs will be.   If you have any questions please contact our admissions specialists by calling 888-443-3869.Detox implies to assist in getting rid of the contaminants (poisons) from a body. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive.

      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      Connecticut Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Widespread cocaine use continues to be a major drug threat in Connecticut. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone.For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. These are often part of larger public or community health agency networks within the government. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.

      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities.
