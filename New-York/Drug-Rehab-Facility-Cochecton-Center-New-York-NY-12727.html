      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience.
