      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.
