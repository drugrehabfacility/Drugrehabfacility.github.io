      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      This can be seen in the cultural festivals, architecture, and history museums around the city.
