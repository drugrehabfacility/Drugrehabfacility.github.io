      Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. There are many explanations for why giving up alcohol needs a critical dedication. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.

      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy.
