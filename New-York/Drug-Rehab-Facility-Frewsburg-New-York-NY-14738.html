    <p>
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Ohio Drug & Alcohol Rehab While no single treatment works for every person, a unique process will be created for you. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.
