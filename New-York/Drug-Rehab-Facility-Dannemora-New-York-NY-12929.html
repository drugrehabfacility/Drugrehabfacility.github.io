      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
