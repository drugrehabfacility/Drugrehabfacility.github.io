      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      Our specialists will connect you with a detox facility where you'll receive high-quality detox care tailored to your individual needs. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy.

      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.
