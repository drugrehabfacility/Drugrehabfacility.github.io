      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation.

      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared.
