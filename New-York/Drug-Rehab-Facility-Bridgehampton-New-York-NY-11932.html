      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. 
      RehabCenter.net offers free information about Ohio’s residential rehab programs. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 
      Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible. As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer.
