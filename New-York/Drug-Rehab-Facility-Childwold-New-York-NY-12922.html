      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.

      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs.Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care.
