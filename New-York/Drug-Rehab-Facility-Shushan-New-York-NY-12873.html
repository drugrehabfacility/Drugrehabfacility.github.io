      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Patients are given sedation if needed and IV vitamin infusions. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. 
      Our Inpatient Detox and Treatment programs will change your outlook on life and even make you more successful. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance.We Can Help You Find Drug & Alcohol Rehab Detox Clinics & Centers In Connecticut CT That Accept Your Insurance: Aetna Insurance Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Connecticut CT, Cigna Insurance Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Connecticut CT, Alcohol, Drug Rehab & Detoxification Centers Covered by Medicaid Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehab & Detoxification Centers Covered by Medicare Insurance Connecticut CT, Alcohol, Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Covered by Military Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Treatment Covered by Amerihealth Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Detox & Rehabs Covered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Clinics Covered by Humana Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Clinics Covered by United Behavioral Health Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Rehabs & Detox Treatment Covered by Value Options Insurance Connecticut CT, Drug, Alcohol Treatments & Detox Covered by Tricare Insurance Connecticut CT, United Healthcare Insurance Drug Rehab & Detox Centers Connecticut CT.There is more than one way to treat drug addiction.  For residents of Connecticut, programs such as alcohol detox, oxycotin detox, and heroin detox are prevalent in many cities.  Most people think that withdrawal is detox, so they try to “self medicate” or detox by themselves.  Detox programs are actually able to remove drug residue from an addicts system, and are much more effective than simply “going cold turkey” by yourself.  Connecticut is seeing an increase in these types of detox programs. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision.Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role.3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost. 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs.

      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.
