      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery.
