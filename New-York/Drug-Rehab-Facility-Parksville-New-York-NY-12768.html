      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence.

      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. 
      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. 
      The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals.
