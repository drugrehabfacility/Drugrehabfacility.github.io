      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      Your care will be monitored around the clock by doctors, nurses and technicians with the use of cardiac telemetry and video technology. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available.
