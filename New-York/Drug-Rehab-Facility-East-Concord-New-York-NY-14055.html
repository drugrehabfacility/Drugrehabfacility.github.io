      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      We make the most effective, affordable, top-rated drug detox facilities available to help you beat addiction. The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released.
