      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.

      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down.

      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems.

      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate.But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice.
