      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. Ohio detox centers understand how difficult it can be to overcome addiction, and will guide you safely through detox and withdrawal with a lowered risk for health complications. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition. 
      Some of these dangers can include seizures and even death.
