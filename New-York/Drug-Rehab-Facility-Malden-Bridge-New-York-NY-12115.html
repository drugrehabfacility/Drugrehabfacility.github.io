      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy.
