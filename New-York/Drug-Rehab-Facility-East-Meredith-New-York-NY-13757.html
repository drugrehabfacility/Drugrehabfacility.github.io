      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. 
      Inpatient detox centers provide patients with a place to live while their undergo detox. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common.
