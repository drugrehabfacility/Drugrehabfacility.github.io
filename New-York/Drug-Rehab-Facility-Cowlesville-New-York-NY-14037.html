      You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Home-Like Comfort – Far from a stark, hospital-like environment, our drug and alcohol detox facilities are home-like and welcoming.

      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
