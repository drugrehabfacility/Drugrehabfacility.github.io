      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services.
