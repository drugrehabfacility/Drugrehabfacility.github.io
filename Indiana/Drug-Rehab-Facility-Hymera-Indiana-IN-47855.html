      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Whether you are looking for a drug detox in Boston or any other area, we can help.

      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. 
      The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.
