      In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision.
