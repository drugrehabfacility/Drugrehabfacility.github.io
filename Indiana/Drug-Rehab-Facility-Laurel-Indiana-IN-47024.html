      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
