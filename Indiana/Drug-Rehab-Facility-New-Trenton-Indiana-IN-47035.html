      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range.
