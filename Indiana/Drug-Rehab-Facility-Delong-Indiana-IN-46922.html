      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. 
      There are priority populations in many state rehab centers.
