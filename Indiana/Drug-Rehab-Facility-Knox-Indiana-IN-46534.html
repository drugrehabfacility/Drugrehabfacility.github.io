      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      The alcoholic has lost the selection of will in regards to drinking. At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs.

      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so.
