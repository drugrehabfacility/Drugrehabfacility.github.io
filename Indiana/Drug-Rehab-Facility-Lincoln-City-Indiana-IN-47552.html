      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security.Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.

      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
