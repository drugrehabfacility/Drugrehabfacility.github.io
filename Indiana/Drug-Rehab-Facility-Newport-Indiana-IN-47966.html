      800-483-2193 Rapid Detox Centers A relatively new method of assisting those who are addicted to opiates in overcoming the physical dependence that they suffer from is the rapid detox method. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
