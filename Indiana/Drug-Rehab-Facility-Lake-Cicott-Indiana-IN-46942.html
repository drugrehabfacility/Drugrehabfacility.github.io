      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms.
