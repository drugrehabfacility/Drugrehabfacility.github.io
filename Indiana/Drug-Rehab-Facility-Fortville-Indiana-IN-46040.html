      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
