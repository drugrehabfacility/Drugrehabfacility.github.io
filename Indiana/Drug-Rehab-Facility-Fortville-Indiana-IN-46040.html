      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.

      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7.
