      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery.

      If you’re looking for help in Bloomington, Chicago, or Rockford, local Illinois detox centers are found in abundance offering access to the treatment necessary to fuel recovery. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE).

      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use.

      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice.
