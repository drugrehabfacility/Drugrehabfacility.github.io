      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone.
