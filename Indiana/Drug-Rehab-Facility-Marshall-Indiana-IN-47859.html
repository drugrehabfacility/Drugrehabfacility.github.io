      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses.

      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      Group Therapy: Drug use and addiction turns many addicts into introverted isolationists. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      Holistic treatments should involve the person's entire life into alignment. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.

      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times.

      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways.While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal.

      She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again.Patients travel to our center from around the world due to the success and safety of our procedure. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. If you aren’t sure where or how to find these resources we can help though our find a meeting web application or getting you connected to what other resources you might be looking for. .
