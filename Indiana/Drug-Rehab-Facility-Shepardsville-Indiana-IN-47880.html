      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      These include the Christian Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Centers and Harbor Light detox and residential centers, which can be found nationwide, as well as a variety of other rehab centers and organizations dedicated to residential rehabilitation and support based on their specific faith traditions.
