      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it.

      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. How can I choose the best among drug detox centers in Chicago? 
      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. 
      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.

      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important.
