      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.

      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Our treatment helpline will connect you with facilities in Danbury, Hartford, Stamford and West Haven as well as throughout all other areas of the state.

      From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. 
      Christian detox programs utilize the teachings of the bible for support and strength during the drug detoxification process while incorporating prayer and other Christian principles into every facet of the treatment process. 
      Outpatient detoxification as safe and effective as inpatient detoxification for those with mild withdrawal benefits those with positive, supportive family circumstances or job situations can continue to work and maintain day-to-day activities with fewer disruptions greater social support opportunities than inpatient increased risk of relapse resulting due to easy access of drugs/alcohol less expensive less time consuming not appropriate for all patients; requires assessment retain greater freedom suitable for those with high motivation to complete detox Inpatient detoxification 24/7 medical support cases of heavy alcohol/drug dependence or chronic use cases of previous complications or intense symptoms of withdrawal higher cost may encourage unnecessary dependence on hospital staff more likely to complete detoxification process than outpatient suitable for suicidal or homicidal patients suitable for those at risk of potentially life-threatening complications of withdrawal suitable for those in adverse or disruptive family or job situations suitable for those not able to travel daily to a treatment facility suitable for those with severe or medically complicated withdrawal Being anxious about entering a detox treatment program is natural.Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process.It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab. 
      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause.
