      Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
