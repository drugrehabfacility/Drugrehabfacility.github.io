      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. 
      People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. While less common, cocaine, sedatives, and hallucinogens were also reasons for seeking out drug treatment in Nevada. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
