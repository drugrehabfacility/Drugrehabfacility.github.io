      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. These individuals may not know that there are options for them. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again.
