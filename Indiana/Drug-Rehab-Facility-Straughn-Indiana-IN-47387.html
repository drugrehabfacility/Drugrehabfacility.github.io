    <p>
      There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. Multi-dimensional family therapy: is specially meant to help addicts recover through the support of their families. 
      Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol.
