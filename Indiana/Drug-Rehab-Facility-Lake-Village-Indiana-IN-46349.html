      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. This can be seen in the cultural festivals, architecture, and history museums around the city. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts.
