      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.

Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.
