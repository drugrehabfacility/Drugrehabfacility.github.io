      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. 
      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      This is an important part of addiction treatment.
