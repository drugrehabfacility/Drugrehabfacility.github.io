      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Opiate addiction is killing thousands of people every year.

      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. Quick drug detox is the most efficient method of drug addiction treatment.Drug Detox in New Jersey Finding The Best Drug Detox In NJ The Need For Drug Detox In New Jersey With drug use in New Jersey increasing each year, the need for drug detox facilities has also increased. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.
