      There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut. Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. 
      You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE!

I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2.
