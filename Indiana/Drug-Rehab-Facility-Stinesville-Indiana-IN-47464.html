      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever!

      Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.
