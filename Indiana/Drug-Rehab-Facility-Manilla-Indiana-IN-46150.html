      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy.
