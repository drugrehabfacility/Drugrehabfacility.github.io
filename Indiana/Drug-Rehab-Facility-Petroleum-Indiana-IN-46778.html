      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program.
