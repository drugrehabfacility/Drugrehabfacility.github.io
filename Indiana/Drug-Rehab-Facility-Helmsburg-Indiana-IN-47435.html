      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine.
