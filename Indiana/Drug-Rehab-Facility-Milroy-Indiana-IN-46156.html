      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program. If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control.
