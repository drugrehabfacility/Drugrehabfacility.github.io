      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living.
