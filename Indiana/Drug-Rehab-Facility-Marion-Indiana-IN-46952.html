      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
