      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend.
