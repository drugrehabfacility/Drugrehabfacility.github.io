      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification.

      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control.
