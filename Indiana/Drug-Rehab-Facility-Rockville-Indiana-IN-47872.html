      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. 
      The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process.
