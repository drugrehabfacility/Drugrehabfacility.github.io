      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 21% were admitted for alcohol rehab while the remaining for drug rehab.

      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. 
      All others are not considered regardless of media hype. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
