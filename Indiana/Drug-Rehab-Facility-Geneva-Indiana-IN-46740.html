      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. All others are not considered regardless of media hype. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms.
