      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. This session can e a group or individual session. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.
