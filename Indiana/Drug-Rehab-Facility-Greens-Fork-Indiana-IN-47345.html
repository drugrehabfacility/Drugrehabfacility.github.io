      The length of stay for detox can vary, the above is a general guide, so please contact Sunrise Detox directly to learn more about what specific needs will be.   If you have any questions please contact our admissions specialists by calling 888-443-3869.Detox implies to assist in getting rid of the contaminants (poisons) from a body. 
      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      Please leave us your questions or comments about detox.
