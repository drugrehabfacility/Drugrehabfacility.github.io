      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded.
