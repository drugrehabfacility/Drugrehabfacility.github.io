      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others.
