      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases.
