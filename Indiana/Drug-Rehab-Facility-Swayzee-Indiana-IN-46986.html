      If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.

      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. 
      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care.

      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in.
