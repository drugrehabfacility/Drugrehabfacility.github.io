      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. This is primarily for safety and security of the patient. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
