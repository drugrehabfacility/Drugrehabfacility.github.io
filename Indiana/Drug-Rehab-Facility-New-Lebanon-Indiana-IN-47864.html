      Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics.
