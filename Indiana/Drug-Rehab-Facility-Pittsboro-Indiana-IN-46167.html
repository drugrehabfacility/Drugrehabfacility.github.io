      Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. 
      Hazelden Betty Ford, Chicago (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Hazelden Betty Ford has made a few appearances on our top ten lists across the country, and sure enough, the organization’s Chicago location is one of the best in the state of Illinois. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Loans: Many treatment centers provide financing, and there are even specialty loan companies specifically for the purpose of funding treatment for individuals. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
