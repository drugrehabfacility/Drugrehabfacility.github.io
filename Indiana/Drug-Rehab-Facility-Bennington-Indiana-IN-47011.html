      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? 
      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone.

In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time.
