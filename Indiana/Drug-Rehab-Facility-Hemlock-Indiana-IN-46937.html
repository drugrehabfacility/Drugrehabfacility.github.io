      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. The following cities in Connecticut are known to have a detox center. 
      Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower. If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable.People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story. 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      The medical expert assists the particular patients from the process by helping them relieve the pains which they encounter.During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). 
      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs.
