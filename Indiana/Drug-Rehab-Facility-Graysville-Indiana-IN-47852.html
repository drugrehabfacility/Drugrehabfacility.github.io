      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more. 
      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery.The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount.

      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures.
