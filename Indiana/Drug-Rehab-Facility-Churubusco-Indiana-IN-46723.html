      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. In contrast, most states are dealing with high drug detox center admissions for heroin and prescription opioid abuse while meth is on the decline nationally. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.

      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. Let us help find a program that suits your needs.

And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs.
