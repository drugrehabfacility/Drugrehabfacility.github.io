      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers.
