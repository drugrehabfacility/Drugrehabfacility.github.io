      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. A lot of individuals wonder if this organization satisfies them.

      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible.
