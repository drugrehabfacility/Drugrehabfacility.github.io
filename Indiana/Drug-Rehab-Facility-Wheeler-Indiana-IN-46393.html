      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.

      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective.The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
