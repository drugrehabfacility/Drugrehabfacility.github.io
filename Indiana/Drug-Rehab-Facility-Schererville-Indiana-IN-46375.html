      Drug Detox Programs Many individuals simply cannot or will not deal with the withdrawal symptoms associated with natural detox. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center.

      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program.
