      If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment? 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      We know you are a good person needing help, and we have helped hundreds before you. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected.

      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink.
