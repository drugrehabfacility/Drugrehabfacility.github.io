      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly.
