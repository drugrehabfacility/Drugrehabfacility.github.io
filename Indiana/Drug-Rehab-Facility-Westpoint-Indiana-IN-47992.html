      While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. The holistic therapy in detox facilities in Washington give someone the peace of mind and body so they can begin to feel overall health and wellbeing again. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. You can also choose to take advantage of our in-home drug detox programs, which bring the benefits of our facilities to the comfort of your private residence. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin.

Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.
