      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
