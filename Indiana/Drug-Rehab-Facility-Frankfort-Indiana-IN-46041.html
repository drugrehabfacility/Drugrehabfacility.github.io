      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention.
