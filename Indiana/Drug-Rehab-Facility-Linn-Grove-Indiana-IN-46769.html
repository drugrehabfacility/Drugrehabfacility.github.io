      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox.
