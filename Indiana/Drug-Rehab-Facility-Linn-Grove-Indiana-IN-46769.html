      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
