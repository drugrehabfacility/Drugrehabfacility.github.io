      Give us a call and start the recovery process today.  1-800-819-9973 Rapid Detox Drug and Alcohol Detoxification has long been accepted as an essential, first step towards recovery from addiction. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. Different Fairview UT 84629 organizations use different styles in rehabilitating addicts with some recommending detoxification of the patient first, then medical therapy, behavior therapy and then relapse prevention. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.

      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. If you have any queries or concerns about our detox process, call us now at (201) 549-8050. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction.
