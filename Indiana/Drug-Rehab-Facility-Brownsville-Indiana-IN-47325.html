      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace.
