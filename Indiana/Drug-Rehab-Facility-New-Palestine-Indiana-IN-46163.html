      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015.

      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far.
