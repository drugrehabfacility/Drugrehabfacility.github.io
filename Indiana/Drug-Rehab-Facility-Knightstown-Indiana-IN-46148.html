      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses.

      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio.

      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications?

      Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
