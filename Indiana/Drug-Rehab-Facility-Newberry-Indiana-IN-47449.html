      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. The particular Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois even offers this medication regarding Clonidine as well as Naltrexone through the detox procedure. 
      Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
