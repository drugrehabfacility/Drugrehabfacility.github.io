      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.

      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against.
