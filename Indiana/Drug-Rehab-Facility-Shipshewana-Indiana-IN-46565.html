      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
