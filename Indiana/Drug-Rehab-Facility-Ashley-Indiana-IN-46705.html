G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 - OR - Request a Callback G&G Holistic Addiction Treatment Program is a nationally recognized drug and alcohol rehab and treatment center with a comprehensive and integrated Mind-Body-Spirit approach to the treatment of addictions and co-occurring disorders. 
      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. Those who get treated and then quit going to meetings since they believe they're " cured " almost always return to drinking eventually. 
      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
