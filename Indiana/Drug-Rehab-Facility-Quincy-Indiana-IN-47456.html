      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort.
