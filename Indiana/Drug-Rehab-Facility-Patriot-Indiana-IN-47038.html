      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible.
