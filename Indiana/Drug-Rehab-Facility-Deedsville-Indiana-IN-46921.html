      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor.
