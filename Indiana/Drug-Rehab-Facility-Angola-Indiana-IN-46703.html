      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies? If you think yourself or someone you know has crossed the line of social drinking into having a drinking problem cal us.
