A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. 
      These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body.The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free.

      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice.
