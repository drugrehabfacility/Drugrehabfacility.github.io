      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. 
      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol.
