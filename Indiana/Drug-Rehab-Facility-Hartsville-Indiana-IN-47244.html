      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Though alcohol addiction is prevalent in Maryland, only 11. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you.
