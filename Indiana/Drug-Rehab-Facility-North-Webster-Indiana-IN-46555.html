      These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health.
