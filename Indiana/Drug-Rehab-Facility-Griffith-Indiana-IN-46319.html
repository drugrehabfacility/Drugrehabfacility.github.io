      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
