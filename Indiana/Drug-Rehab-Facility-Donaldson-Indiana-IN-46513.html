      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety.
