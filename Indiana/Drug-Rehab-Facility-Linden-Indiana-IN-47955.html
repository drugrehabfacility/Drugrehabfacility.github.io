      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.
