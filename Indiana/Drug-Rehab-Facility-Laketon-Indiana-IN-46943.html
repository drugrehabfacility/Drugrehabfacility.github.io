      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible. Cells in the kidneys move waste out of the body altogether. 
      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.
