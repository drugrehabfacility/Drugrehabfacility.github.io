      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there.
