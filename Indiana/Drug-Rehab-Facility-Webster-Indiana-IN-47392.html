      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. She had a concerned look on her face so I explained that Arianna has autism, and that in her mind, because the cheeseburger was cut in half, she thinks its broken and can’t eat it. 
      RehabCenter.net offers free information about Ohio’s residential rehab programs. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse.

      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. A person's age and health condition also plays a role. 
      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs.

Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
