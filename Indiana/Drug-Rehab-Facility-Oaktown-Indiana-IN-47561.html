      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people.

      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.
