      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration).
