      The healthcare professional assures that the prescription of the medicine is within an inferior volume. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again.
