      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox? Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. You may discover there are some meetings in your city that provide babysitting that is totally free. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind.

      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.
