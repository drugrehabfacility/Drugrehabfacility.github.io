      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life.
