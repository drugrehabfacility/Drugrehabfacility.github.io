      What kinds of Hartford drug detox programs are available? If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Amphetamine Withdrawal Symptoms – Often the least severe type of withdrawal users of amphetamines like methamphetamine, cocaine and prescriptions like Ritalin and Adderall experience symptoms like excessive sleeping and eating, depression, mood swings, paranoia and anxiety. 
      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. 
      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
