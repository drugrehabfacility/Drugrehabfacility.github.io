      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
