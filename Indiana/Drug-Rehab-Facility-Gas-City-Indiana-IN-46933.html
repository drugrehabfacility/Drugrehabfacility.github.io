      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on.
