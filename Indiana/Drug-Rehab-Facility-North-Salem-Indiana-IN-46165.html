      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again.
