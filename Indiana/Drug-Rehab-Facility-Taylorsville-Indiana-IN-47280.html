      It gets rid of the toxic chemicals that have built up in your system from drug use. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      If you need alcohol for your body to feel normal, then you likely need help. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.

      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible.
