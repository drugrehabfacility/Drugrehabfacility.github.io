      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Paying for Treatment Options for paying for amphetamine rehab in Massachusetts are many, though health insurance coverage offers the most comprehensive and convenient method. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
