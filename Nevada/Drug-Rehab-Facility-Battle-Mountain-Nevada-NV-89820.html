      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
