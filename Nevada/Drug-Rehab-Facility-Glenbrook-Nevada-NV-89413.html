      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM.

      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction. 
      At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.
