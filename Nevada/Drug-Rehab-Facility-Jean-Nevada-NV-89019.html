      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. 
      Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started? We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need.
