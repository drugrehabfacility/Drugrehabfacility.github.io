      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction.

      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. A person's age and health condition also plays a role. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. With lovely rural areas and bustling industrious cities, there is much to see and do no matter if you love the city life or the country life. 
      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
