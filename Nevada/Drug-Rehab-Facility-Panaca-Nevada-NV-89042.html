      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear.
