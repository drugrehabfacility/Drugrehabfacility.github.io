      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.

      Call 800-483-2193 now to speak with a treatment advisor!  There are many different types of detox centers, each geared around providing a specific type of detoxification, a specific type of treatment or a specific level of care and monitoring. 
      The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. Alcoholics do not understand that they're going to become an individual, and don't the folks. 
      Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems.
