      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.
