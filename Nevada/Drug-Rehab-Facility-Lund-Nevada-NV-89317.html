      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room.
