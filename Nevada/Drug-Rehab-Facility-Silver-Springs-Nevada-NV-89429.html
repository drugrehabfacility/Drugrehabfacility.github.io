      Medical detox centers offer inpatient detoxification services to patients who are already in the treatment facility or who plan on being admitted into treatment following their detoxification. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. 
      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices.
