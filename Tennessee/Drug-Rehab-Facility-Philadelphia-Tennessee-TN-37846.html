      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.

      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Whether you’re having nausea or you feel like you need someone to speak with, our professionals will be there for you. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems.
