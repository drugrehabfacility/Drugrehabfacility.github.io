      Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings.

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly.
