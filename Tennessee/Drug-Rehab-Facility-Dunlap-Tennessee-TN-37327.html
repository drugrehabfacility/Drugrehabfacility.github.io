      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.
