      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts.
