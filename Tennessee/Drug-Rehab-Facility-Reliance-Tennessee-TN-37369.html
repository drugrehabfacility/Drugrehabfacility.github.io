      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
