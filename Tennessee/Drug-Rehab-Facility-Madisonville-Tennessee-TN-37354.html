      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. The clinical staff can help each addict and alcoholic find what they need personally to recover. 
      They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission.

      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy: Your addiction didn’t happen in a vacuum. We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used.A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. 
      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.
