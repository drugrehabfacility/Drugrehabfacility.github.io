    <p>
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. 
      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. By the time detox becomes necessary, the body has temporarily forgotten how to produce positive sensations. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures.
