      In the various drug detoxification programs and alcohol detox treatments, the body is purged of the poisons accumulated in the body as a consequence of addiction. The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.
