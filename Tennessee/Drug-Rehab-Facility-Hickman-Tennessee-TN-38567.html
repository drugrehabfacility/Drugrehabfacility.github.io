      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. Expect wonderful add ons such as full suites, private rooms with private bathroom; standard rooms include use of internet, cell phones, prime locations, outstanding food and great supports. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.

    <p>
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Therefore the right detox withdrawal advice gives you a new lease on life. Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
