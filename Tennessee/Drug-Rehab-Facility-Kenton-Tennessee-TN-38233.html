      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015.
