      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.
