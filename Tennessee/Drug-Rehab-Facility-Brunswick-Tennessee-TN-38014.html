      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.
