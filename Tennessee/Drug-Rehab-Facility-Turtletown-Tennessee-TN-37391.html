      IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. Personal events, trauma and the environment does affect drug use. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery.

Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab.
