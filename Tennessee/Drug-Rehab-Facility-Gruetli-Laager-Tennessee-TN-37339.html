      I am a critical person and cannot find any issue to complain about. Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! Your will worry you and possibly fill you with shame. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab.
