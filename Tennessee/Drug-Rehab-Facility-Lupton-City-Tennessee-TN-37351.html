      Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. Patients are given sedation if needed and IV vitamin infusions. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities.
