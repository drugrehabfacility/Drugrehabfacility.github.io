      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      For more information on this facility go to www.zepfcenter.org/ 5. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
