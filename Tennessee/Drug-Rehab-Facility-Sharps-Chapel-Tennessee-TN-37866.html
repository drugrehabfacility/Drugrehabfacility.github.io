      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. 
      Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage.
