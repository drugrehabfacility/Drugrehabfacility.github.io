      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons.
