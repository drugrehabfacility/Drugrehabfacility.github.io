      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.

      Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      That’s why we’re here – to guide you along the path to recovery, one step at a time. Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol.
