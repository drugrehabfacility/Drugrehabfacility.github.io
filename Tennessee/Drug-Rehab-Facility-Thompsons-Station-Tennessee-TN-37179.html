      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
