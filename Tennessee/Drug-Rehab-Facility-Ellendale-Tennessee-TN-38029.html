      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery.

      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment.
