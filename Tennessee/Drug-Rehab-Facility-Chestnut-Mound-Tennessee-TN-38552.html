      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.
