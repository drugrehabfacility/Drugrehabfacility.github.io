      Do you know someone who is looking for a drug and alcohol detox center in Illinois? 
      5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be? Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. You may not know what’s next for you after detox. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
