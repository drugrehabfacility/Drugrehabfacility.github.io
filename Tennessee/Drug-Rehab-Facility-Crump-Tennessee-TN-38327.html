      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.
