      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects.

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. 
      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting.

      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again.
