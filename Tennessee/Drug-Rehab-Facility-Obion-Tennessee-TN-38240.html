      Translation to English by Sergio Cadena 14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 3 months Ago Get to know our Emcee for this year's East Bay Center's 2nd Annual Gala Patrick Little of WPRI.com. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.
