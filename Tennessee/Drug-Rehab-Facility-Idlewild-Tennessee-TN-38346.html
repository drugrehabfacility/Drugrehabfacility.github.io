      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns.

      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      The supervisor (behavioral health tech) Kevin is caring and works hard to make sure all patients are safe and well taken care of.
