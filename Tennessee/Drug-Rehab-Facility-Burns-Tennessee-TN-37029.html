      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.Benzo and Alcohol Detox and Rehab Withdrawal Advice from the Drug Rehab Advisor People needing benzo detox withdrawal advice are caught in a trap.
