      Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs? 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction.
