      This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
