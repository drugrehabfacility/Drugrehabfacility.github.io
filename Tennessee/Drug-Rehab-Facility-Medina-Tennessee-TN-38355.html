      Neurofeedback – During drug detox, many clients find that neurofeedback helps to reduce pain, anxiety and drug cravings, improve concentration, and restore sleep. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. 
      Patients travel to our center from around the world due to the success and safety of our procedure. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. 
      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. 
      Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.
