      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.

      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
