      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life.
