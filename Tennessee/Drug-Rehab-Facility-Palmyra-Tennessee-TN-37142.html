      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol.
