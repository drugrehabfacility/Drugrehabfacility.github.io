      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Drug Detox Drug detoxification or drug detox is used to reduce primarily the withdrawal symptoms in an individual addicted to drugs. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. A study made on alcohol abuse admissions show a step increase in the number of admissions for alcohol abuse in New Jersey detox centers from 344 in the year 2001 to 571 in 2008. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high).
