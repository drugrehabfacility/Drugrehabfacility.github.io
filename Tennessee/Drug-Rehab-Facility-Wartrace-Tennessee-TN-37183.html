      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. 
      These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away.

      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well.Your love and support is needed to help the person survive.

Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications.
