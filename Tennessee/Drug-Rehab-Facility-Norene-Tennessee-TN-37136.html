      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. 
      A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received.
