      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition.
