      The most common of these drug detox programs is Christian drug detox. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.
