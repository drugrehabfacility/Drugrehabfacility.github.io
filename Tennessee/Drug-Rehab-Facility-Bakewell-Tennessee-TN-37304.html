      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.

      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after.Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them.
