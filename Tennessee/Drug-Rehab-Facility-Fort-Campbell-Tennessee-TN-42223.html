      Detoxifying from opioid dependency: Withdrawal from heroin and opioid painkillers can come with very powerful symptoms that begin within six hours of quitting. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.

      Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      Do you or your loved one wake up and have to use drugs right away to get the day started?
