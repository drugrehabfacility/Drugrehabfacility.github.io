      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
