      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs.

      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all.

      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
