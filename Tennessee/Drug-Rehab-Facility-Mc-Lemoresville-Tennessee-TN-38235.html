      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need.

    </p>
    <p>
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean.
