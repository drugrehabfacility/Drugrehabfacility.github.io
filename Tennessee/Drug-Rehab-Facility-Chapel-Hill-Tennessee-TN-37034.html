      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse.

      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.

      All in-patient detox centers offer medically supervised care by either medical professionals closely monitoring a detox or by holistic detox specialists providing 24/7 attention under the guidance of detox doctors. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services.People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.

      If you are skeptical of their success, you need only to head over to their Facebook page, where thousands of former clients and members of the community come together. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain.
