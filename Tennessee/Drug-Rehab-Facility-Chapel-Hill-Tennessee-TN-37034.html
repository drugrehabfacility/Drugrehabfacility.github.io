      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.
