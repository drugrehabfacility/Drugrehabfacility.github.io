      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Holistic Drug Detox Programs Many holistic drug detox programs incorporate yoga.
