      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense.
