      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story.
