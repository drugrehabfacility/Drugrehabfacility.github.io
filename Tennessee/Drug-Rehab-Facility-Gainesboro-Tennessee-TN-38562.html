      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so.
