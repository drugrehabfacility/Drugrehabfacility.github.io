Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.

A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 800-483-2193 Rapid Detox Centers A relatively new method of assisting those who are addicted to opiates in overcoming the physical dependence that they suffer from is the rapid detox method.
