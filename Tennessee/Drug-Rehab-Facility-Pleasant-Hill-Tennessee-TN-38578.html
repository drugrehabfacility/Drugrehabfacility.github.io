      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab.
