      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons.

      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs.
