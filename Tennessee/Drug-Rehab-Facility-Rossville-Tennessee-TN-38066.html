      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.

      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery.

      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.
