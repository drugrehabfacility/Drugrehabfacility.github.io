    <p>
      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! 
      If you come across any problems or wish to ask a question, please do not hesitate to contact our Support service using the contact us form.Drug Detox Drug detoxification or drug detox is used to reduce primarily the withdrawal symptoms in an individual addicted to drugs.

      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.

      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered.
