      The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. 
      Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself.

      When the addicts history of drug abuse is so severe that this type of drug is required it is often dispensed to the addict while they are in an inpatient drug or alcohol treatment facility. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free.
