Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center.
