      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year.
