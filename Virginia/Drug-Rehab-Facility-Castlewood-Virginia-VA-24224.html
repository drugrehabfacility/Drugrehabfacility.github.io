      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time.The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.
