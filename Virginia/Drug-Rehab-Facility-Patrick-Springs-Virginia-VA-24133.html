      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs.

      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.

      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else.
