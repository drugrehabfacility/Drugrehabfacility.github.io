      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
