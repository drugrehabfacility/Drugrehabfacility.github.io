      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
