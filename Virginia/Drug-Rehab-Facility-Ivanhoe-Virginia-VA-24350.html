      When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur.
