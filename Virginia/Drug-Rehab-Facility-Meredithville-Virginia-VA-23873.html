      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.

The length of stay for detox can vary, the above is a general guide, so please contact Sunrise Detox directly to learn more about what specific needs will be.   If you have any questions please contact our admissions specialists by calling 888-443-3869.Detox implies to assist in getting rid of the contaminants (poisons) from a body.
