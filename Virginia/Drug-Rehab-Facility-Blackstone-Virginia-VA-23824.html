      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal.
