It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers.

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
