      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. 
      We want to assist you in finding the best New Jersey detox centers for your recovery. Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist.
