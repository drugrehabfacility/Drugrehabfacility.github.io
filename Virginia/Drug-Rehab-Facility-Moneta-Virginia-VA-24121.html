(AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse.

      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
