      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. IV therapy will safely and effectively remove the toxins from your body.

      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      Inpatient detox centers provide patients with a place to live while their undergo detox. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 
      Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.

      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels.
