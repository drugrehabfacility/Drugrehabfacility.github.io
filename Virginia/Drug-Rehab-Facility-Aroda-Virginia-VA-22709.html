      Natural Drug Detox Programs Naturally overcoming physical drug dependence is another method of detox that can be very effective and liberating at the same time. Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.

      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. In the various Hartford drug detox centers, there are programs available for drug detoxification in inpatient as well as outpatient environments. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery.
