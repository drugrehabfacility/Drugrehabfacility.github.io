      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery.
