      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years.

      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      These truly expert withdrawal or medical detox program will nourish the body with nutrients, food, physical and holistic attention. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
