      800-483-2193 Rapid Detox Centers A relatively new method of assisting those who are addicted to opiates in overcoming the physical dependence that they suffer from is the rapid detox method. Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. 
      Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
