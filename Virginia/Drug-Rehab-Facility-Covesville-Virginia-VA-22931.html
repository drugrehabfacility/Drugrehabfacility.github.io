      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. With lovely rural areas and bustling industrious cities, there is much to see and do no matter if you love the city life or the country life. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice.

      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.

      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. As a person begins to feel better, they can begin to take a more active part in the therapy part of rehab. 
      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober.
