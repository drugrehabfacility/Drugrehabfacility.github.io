      Drug Detox 
      Treatment </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
