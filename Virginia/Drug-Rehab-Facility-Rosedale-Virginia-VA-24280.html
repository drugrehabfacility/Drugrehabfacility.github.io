      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.

      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance.

      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.

      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.
