    <p>
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Of course, if they are going to crave for more heroin, it is the time that they will have the particular revulsion signs and symptoms.
