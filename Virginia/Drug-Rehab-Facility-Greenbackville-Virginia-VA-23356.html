      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Our therapists will assist you through our world class treatment program and facility, must medical treatment or detoxing be appropriate or needed. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department. 
      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results.

      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. 
      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit.

      Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Treatment Center Finder will connect you with the right Massachusetts rehab for you or your loved one. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist. 
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used.
