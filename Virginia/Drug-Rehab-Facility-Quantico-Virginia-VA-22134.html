      Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.
