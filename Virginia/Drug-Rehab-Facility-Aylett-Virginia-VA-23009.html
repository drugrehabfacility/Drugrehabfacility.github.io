      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      From Cleveland in the north to Cincinnati in the south and all points between, Ohio has an indelible place in the American story.
