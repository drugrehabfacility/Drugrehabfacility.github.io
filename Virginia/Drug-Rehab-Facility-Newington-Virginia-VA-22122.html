      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
