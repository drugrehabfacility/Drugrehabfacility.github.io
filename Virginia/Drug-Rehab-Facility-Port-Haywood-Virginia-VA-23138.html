      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. Detox facilities all over the country are not created equal that is why detox facilities in Washington give one of the most comfortable and home like experiences for each client that needs to separate themselves from their drug use and drinking. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin.

      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.

      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs.
