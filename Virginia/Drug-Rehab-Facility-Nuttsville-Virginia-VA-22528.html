      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
