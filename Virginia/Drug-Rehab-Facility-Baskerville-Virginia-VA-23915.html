      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
