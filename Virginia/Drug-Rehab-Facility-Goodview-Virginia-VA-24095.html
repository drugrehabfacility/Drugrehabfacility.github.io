      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      It is always advisable to inquire about scholarships or grants available for low-income individuals when seeking a treatment center. These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back.
