      Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem.

      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers.
