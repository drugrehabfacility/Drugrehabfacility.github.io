      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances.
