      Testimonial by John Theresa, Jim, Mark, Shannon, Renata, AlL the people at the St. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. 
      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization.

The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history.

It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal.
