      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. AUD is the name doctors give to the range of issues people have with drinking. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. The supervisor (behavioral health tech) Kevin is caring and works hard to make sure all patients are safe and well taken care of. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs.

      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. 
      Free rehab centers and public assistance for rehab do exist. Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut.
