      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient.
