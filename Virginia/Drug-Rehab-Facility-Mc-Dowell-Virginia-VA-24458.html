      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking.

Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. Call now to speak with a caring treatment specialist.
