      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.Home Drug Detox Drug Detox Programs Drug Detox Programs Many different drug detox programs exist to provide patients with the best possible drug detoxification and care for their individual needs. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center.
