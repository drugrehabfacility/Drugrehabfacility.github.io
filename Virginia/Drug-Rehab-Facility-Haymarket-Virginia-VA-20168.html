      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. This is done at an individual or a group level, Fairview UT 84629 and may cover crisis counseling and daily/weekly counseling support. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal.
