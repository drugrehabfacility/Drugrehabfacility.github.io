      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.

      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence.

      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being.Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many.You should ask whether the group has a telephone listing. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Drug And Alcohol Detox Centers Drug and alcohol detoxification is one of the first steps in the treatment process toward recovery from drug and alcohol addiction.
