      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else.

Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.
