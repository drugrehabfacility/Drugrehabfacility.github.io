      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

      Translation to English by Sergio Cadena 14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 3 months Ago Get to know our Emcee for this year's East Bay Center's 2nd Annual Gala Patrick Little of WPRI.com. The information is free, the call is free and so is the referral. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
