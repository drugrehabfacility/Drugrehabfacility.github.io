      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).
