      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
