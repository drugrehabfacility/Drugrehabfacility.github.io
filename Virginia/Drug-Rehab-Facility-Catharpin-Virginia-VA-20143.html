      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years.
