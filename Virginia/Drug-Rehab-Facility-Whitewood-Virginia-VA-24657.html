      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own.
