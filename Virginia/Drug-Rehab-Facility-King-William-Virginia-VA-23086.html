      Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics.

      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Patients travel to our center from around the world due to the success and safety of our procedure.

      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. 
      I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better.
