      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. Detox in NJ, especially for alcohol abusers, can take fluctuating amounts of time. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist.
