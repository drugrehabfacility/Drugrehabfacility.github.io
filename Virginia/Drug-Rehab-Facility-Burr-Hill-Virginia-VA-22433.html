      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Northland Treatment Center, Milford (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Northland Treatment Center is an outpatient drug and alcohol addiction rehab facility. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is.
