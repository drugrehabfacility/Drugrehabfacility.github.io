      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
