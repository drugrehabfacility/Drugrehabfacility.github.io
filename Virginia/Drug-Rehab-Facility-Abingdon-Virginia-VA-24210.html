      After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife. Call us now, so we can help find the best path for you today. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs.

      When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically. 
      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.

This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.
