      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. 
      Medical detox is available through high quality drug detox centers under the supervision of medical professionals. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      115 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday! Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. That’s why we’re here – to guide you along the path to recovery, one step at a time. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin.

      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs.

      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient.
