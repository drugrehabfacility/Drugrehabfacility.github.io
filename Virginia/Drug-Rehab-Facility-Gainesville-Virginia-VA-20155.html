      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. Glenbeigh, Niles (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today An affiliate of Cleveland Clinic, Glenbeigh is an alcohol and drug addiction treatment center staffed by licensed independent social workers, physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, certified chemical dependency counselors and clergy. 
      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
