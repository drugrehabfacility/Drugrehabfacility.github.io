      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death.

      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment.

      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members.With practicing kindness, while continuing to work on yourself as a person, you may find relapse prevention is an inspiring and gratifying. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though.
