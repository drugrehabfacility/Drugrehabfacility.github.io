      We refer to 30 different recommended centers which can be categorized into 4 basic withdrawal and detox costs. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them.
