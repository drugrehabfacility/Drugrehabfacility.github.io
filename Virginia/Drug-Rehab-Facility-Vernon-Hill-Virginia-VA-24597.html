      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.
