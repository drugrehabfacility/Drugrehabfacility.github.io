    <p>
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      The medicinal aspects of detox facilities in Washington give someone the physical comfort needed to safely and easily move through the withdrawal symptoms due to their physical dependency on drugs and alcohol. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
