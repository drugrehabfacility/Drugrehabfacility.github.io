      Drug Detox Aid </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. 
      Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction.
