      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
