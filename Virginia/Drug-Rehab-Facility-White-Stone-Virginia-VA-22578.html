      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
