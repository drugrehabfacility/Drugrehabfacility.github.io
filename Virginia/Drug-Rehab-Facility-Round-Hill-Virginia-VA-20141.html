      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.
