      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use.Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. 
      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.

      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial.
