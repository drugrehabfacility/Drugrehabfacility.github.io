      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. 
      If you have any problem while you are here, the techs and Kevin help resolve the issue in a professional manner. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      You may discover there are some meetings in your city that provide babysitting that is totally free. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.

      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.
