If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.
