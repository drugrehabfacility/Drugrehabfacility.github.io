      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them. At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.

      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin.
