      The clinical staff that makes detox facilities in Washington run the way they do are some of the best when it comes to understanding, compassion and helping each client get what they need to have the most effective and comfortable detox imaginable. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency.
