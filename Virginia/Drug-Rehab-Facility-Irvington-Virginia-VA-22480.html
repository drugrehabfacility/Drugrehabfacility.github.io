      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused.
