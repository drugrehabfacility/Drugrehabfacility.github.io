      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery.
