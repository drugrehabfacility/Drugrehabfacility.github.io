      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. 
      Call The 24Hr Addiction Hotline 800-454-6704 WE ACCEPT MOST HEALTH INSURANCE TAKE BACK YOUR LIFE If you or a loved one is in need of help, we're here.It is highly recommended to complete a detox period prior to going into a facility for treatment. These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs.

      After Detox Some individuals find it necessary to enroll in an after program after drug detox is completed to help you rebuild your life. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol.As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.
