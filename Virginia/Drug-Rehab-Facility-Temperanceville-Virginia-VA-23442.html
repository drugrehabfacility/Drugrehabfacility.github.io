But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      Connecticut Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Widespread cocaine use continues to be a major drug threat in Connecticut. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      There are two nurses that are present during the whole procedure and they monitor the patient’s vitals and make sure that the procedure if flawless in its execution.

      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects.

      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.
