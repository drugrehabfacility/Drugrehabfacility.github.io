      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.

As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?
