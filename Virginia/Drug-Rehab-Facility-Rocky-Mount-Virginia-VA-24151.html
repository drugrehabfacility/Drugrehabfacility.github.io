      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.

      Recovery options after drug detox include inpatient rehab, outpatient addiction treatment and therapy.
