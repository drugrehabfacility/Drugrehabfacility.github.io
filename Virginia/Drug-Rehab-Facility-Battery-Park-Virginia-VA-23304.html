      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.

      Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Each person who has to go through the detox facilities in Washington just wants someone who cares while also somehow managing to beat the discomfort of the physical withdrawal from opiates, benzos, alcohol, cocaine and more. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.
