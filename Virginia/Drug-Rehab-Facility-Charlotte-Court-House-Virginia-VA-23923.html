      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      Above the Standard: I believe in only working with people and centers that I personally trust.
