      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises.

      At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
