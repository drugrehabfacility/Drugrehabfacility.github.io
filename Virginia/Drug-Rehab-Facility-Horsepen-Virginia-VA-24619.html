    <p>
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
