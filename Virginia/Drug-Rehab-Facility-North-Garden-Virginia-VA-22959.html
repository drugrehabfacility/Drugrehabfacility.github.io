      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.

      Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms.

      Living Your Recovery Ohio residents are no strangers to drug and alcohol problem. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. On average, detox takes 5 days, but can range from 3 to 10 days. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.

      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs.
