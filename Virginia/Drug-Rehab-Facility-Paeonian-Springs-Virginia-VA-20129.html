      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Of course, if they are going to crave for more heroin, it is the time that they will have the particular revulsion signs and symptoms. 
      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction.
