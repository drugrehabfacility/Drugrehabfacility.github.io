      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. Group Therapy: Drug use and addiction turns many addicts into introverted isolationists. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.
