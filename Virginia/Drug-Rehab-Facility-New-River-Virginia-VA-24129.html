      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug.

Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. 
      State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
