      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 800-483-2193 800-483-2193 Get help for your loved one FEATURED CENTERS Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 Palm Partners Delray Beach, Florida 800-923-2803 Family is Forever.
