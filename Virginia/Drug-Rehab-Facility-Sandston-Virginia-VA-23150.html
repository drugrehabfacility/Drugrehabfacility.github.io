      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run.
