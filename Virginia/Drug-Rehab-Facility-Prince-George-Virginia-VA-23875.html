      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.

Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit.
