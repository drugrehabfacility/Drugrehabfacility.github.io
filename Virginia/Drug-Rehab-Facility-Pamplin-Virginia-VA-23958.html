      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.
