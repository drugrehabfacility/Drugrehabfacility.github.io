      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Aftercare Services in Illinois Illinois comes in 12th in the nation for drug and alcohol overdose. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.
