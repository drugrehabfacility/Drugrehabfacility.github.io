      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. 
      In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance.
