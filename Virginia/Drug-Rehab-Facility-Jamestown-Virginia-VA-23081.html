      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Group Therapy: Drug use and addiction turns many addicts into introverted isolationists. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life.
