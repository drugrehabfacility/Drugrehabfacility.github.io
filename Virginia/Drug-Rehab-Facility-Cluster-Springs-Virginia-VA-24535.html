      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support.
