      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.
