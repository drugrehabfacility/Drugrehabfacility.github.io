      And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s).

      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome.
