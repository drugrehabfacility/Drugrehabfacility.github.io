      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high).

      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay. 
      Find medical detox centers in your area by contacting us toll-free via phone, chat or email. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount.
