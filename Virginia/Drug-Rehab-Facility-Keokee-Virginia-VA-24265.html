      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. 
      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. There are many explanations for why giving up alcohol needs a critical dedication.

      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end.
