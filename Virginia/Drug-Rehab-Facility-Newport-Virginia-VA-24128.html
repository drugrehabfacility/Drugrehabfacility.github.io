      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. If you need a snack, you can visit the cafe-style dining area. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.

      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.

      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.

      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate.Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.
