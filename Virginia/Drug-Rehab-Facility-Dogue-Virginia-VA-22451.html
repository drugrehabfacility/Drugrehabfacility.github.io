      Smiling is considered infectious, so keep on smiling! Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      There are over three hundred drug treatment centers in Maryland.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Maryland.

      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering.
