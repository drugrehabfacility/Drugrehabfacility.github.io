      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.

      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Counseling is a good idea for your full therapeutic of the individual. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor.

      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be?

      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.
