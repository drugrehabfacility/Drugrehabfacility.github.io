      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function.

      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support.At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.

      The goal of drug detox is minimize and manage drug or alcohol withdrawal symptoms in a medically safe setting. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused.
