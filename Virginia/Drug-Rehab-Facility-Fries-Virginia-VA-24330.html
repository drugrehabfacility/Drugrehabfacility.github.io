      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures.
