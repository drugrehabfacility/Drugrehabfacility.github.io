      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. 
      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction. Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. 
      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat.

      Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. If you are in need of immediate assistance, please call our toll-free number and we will help you 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 
      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. 
      In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected.
