      After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      Combining natural medicine and care with traditional medicine can be the most effective detox methods. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process.
