      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. 
      With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own.
