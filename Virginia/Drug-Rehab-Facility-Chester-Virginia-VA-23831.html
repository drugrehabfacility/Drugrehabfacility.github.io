      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Call us today to speak with someone who has gone through what you are going through. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment.
