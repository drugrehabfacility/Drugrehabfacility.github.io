      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. Detox will typically last longer for people who: Need treatment for multiple drugs Have mental illness to be treated as well Have a severe and/or long-term addiction Aren’t complying with treatment Have a severe medical reaction to withdrawal FREE INSURANCE VERIFICATION We accept most insurances, call us to find out for certain.Home > Rehab > Massachusetts> Detox Massachusetts Detox Center Listings Massachusetts has been known for its world class treatment facilities and Massachusetts drug detox centers are no different. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases.
