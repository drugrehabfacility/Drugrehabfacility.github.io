      Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. 
      Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs?
