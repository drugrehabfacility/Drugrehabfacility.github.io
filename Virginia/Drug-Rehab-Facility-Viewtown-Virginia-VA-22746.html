      Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment.
