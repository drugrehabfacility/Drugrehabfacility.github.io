As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies. 
      If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers.
