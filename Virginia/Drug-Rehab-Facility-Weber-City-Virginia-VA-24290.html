      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      Stays may be as short as 7 days costing $15,000 and up. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol.
