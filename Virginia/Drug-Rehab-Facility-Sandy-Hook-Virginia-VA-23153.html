      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered.

      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.

      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction.
