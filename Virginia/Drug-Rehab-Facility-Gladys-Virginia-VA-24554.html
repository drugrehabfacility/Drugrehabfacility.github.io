      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Each individual insurance plan is different, and insurance can greatly help to defray the potential costs. Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
