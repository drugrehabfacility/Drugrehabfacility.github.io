      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Once under general anesthesia and deep sedation, the opiate antagonist is administered and also a strict formula of medications specifically designed to flush out the patients opiate receptors. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      Our therapists will assist you through our world class treatment program and facility, must medical treatment or detoxing be appropriate or needed.
