      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. 
      If you have any questions or comments about our detox facility, please contact United Drug Rehab Group directly.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day.
