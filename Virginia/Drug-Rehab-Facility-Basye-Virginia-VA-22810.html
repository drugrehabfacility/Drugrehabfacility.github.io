      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great.

      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions.
