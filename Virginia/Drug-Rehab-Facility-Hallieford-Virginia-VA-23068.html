      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      You do not have to leave the city to address your needs or the specialized needs of your near and dear ones. A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms.

      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction.

      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Our drug addiction specialists are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
