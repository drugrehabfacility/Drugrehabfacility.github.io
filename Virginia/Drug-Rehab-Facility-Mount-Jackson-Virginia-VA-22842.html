      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Living Your Recovery Ohio residents are no strangers to drug and alcohol problem. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs.

      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. 
      In fact, drug detox and drug rehab go hand in hand because they both must be completed in order for a recovering addict to have the best chance of recovering from their addiction. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind.
