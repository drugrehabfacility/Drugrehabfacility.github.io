For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers.
