      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind.

      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
