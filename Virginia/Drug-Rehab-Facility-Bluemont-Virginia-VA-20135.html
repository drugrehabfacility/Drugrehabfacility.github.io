      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with.
