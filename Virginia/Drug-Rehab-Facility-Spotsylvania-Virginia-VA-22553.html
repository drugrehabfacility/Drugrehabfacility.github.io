      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
