      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. Call now for more information on drug abuse or addiction. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible.
