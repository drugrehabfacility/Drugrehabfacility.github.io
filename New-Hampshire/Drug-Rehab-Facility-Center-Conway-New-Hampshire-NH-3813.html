      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority.
