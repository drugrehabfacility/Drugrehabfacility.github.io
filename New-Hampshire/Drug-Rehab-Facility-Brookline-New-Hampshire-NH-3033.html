      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
