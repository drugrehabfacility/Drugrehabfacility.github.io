      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs.

      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. 
      Attending detox facilities in Washington are merely a beginning on the road to lifetime sobriety and certain steps need to be taken after detox in order for someone to find the success, peace and ease of healthy sober living again or for the first time.Drug and Alcohol Detox Promises offers medically monitored drug and alcohol detox in a home-like environment. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs.
