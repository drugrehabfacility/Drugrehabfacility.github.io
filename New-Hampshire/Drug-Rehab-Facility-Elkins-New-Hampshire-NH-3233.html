      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms. 
      Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more.

      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.
