      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
