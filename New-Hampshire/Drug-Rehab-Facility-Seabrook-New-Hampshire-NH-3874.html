      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. 
      From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey.

      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more.
