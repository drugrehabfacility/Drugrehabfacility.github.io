Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Drug And Alcohol Detox Centers Drug and alcohol detoxification is one of the first steps in the treatment process toward recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery.
