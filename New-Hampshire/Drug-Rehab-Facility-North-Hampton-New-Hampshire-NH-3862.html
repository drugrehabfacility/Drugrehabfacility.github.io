      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. 
      Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
