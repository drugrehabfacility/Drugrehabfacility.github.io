      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.
