      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program.
