      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. Bar none, Detox of South Florida is the best care I have received.
