According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.
