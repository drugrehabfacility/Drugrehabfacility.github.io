      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Once under general anesthesia and deep sedation, the opiate antagonist is administered and also a strict formula of medications specifically designed to flush out the patients opiate receptors.
