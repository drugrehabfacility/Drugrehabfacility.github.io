      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
