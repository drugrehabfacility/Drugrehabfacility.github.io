      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. Free rehab centers and public assistance for rehab do exist. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later.
