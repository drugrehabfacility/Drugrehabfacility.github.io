    <p>
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
