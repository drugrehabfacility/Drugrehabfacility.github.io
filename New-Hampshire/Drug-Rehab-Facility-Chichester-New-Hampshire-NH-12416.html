      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.

Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
