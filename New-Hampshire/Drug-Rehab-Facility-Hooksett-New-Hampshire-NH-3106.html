      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority.

      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
