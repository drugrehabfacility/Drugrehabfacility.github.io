      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice.
