Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. Though the addict fails to remember the uncomfortable side effects in which the consumption of heroin drugs has. 
      Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process.
