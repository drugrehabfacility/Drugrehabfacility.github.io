      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. With specialized treatment programs for teens and young adults, and supportive environments for adult patients, we provide more than just drug detox facilities. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. This allows someone to not so much focus on what is missing in their detox facility in Washington but more so on the next steps needed for them to get sober and stay sober after their physical detox. 
      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety.
