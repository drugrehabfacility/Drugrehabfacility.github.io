      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem.

      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Finding these centers is often just a matter of talking to the leaders of these faith traditions to connect with the resources.
