      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      When the best detox withdrawal advice requires medical help for a medical detox, a proper clinic specializing in detox should be chosen.
