      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great.
