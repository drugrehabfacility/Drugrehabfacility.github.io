      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient.
