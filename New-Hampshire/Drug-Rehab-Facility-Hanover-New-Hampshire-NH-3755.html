      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Massachusetts; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks.

      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey.
