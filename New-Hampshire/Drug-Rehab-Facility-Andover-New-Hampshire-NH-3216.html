      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. 
      The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery. Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery.
