      Addiction Treatment is Pinnacle Medical Detox Staff In order to overcome a drug or alcohol addiction seeking out treatment from a drug detox center or treatment center is essential. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Outpatient detoxification as safe and effective as inpatient detoxification for those with mild withdrawal benefits those with positive, supportive family circumstances or job situations can continue to work and maintain day-to-day activities with fewer disruptions greater social support opportunities than inpatient increased risk of relapse resulting due to easy access of drugs/alcohol less expensive less time consuming not appropriate for all patients; requires assessment retain greater freedom suitable for those with high motivation to complete detox Inpatient detoxification 24/7 medical support cases of heavy alcohol/drug dependence or chronic use cases of previous complications or intense symptoms of withdrawal higher cost may encourage unnecessary dependence on hospital staff more likely to complete detoxification process than outpatient suitable for suicidal or homicidal patients suitable for those at risk of potentially life-threatening complications of withdrawal suitable for those in adverse or disruptive family or job situations suitable for those not able to travel daily to a treatment facility suitable for those with severe or medically complicated withdrawal Being anxious about entering a detox treatment program is natural.
