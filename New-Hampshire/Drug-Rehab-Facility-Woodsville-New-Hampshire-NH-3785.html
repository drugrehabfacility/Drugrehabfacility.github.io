      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox.
