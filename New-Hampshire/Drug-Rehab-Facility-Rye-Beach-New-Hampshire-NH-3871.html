      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab. Thank youMore Testimonials Here Need Help With Drugs or Alcohol?

      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.
