      Successful Detox: This means you'll get the most care from integrative holistic and medical detox providers who specialize in natural care methods. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
