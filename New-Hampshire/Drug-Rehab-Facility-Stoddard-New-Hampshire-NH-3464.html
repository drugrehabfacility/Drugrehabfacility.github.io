      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Internet gives you ample opportunities to compare prices and location of the various centers in and around Chicago; make the most of the opportunity to choose a program. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.
