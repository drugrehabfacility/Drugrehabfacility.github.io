      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. In other instances Alanon members might be uncomfortable since they've told lies especially to cover up for the alcoholic or to stop conflict. 
      Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      You did not want to become dependent or addicted to benzos or alcohol. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible.

A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question.
