      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation). Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety.
