      800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months.When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. 
      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
