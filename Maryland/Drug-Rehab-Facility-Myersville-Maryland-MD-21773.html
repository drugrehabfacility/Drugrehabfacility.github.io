      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs.Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life.
