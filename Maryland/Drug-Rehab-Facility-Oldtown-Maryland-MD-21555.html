      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. 
      The following cities in Connecticut are known to have a detox center. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.

      Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
