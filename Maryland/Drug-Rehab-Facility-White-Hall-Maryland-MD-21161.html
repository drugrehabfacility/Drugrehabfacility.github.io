      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient. 
      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication.
