      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM.As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. They are also are way to increase comfort by helping with sleep, anxiety, and blood pressure. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.

If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.
