      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention.
