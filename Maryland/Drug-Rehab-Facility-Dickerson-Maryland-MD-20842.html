      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
