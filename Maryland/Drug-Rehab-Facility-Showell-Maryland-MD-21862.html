      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room.
