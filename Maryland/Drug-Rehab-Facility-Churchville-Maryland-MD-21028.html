      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed.
