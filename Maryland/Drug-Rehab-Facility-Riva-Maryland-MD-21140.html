      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. After Detox Some individuals find it necessary to enroll in an after program after drug detox is completed to help you rebuild your life. 
      They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover.
