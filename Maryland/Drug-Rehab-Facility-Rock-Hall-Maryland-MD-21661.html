      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever.

      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery! 
      1300857 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 11 months Ago Dear Mr. 
      Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers.Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety.
