      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. 
      Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña. Loans: Many treatment centers provide financing, and there are even specialty loan companies specifically for the purpose of funding treatment for individuals. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone.
