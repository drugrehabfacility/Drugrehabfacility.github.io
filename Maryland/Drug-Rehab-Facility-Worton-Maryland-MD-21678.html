      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. 
      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction.

      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body.

      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly.
