      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.
