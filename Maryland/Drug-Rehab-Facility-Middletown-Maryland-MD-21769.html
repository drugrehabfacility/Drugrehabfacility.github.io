      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. 
      This facility is close to the beach so that patients can experience a tranquil healing program that allows them to get back to nature.
