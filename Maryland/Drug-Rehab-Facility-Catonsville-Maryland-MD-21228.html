      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program.
