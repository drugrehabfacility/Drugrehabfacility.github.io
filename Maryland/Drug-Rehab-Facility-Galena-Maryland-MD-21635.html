      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Getting Help in Illinois Do not feel alone in your fight against your addiction. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
