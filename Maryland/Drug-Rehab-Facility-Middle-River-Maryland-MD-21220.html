      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
