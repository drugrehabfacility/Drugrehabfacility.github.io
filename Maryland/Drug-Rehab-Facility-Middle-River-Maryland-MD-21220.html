      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).
