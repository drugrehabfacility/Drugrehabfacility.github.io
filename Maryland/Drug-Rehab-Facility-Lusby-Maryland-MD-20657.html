      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. 
      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. 
      The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts.
