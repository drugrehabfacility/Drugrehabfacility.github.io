      The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. 
      Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower.
