      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. 
      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others.
