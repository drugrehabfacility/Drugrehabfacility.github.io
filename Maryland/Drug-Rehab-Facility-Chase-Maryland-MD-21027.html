      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings.
