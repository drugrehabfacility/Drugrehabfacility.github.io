      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. They are searching for the same high that the pills gave them. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut. Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely.
