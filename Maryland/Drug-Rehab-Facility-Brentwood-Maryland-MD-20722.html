      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.
