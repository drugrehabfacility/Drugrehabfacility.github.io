      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well.

Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
