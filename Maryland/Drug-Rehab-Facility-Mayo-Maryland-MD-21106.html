      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
