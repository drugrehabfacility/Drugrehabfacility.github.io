      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer.

There are over three hundred drug treatment centers in Maryland.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Maryland. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
