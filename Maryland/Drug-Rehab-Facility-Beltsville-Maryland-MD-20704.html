From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      Skilled and continuous assessment of medical needs during the detoxification process, and rock solid procedures for dealing with any sort of medical emergency that may occur.The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction.
