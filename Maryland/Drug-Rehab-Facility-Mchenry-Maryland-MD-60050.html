      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body.

      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county.
