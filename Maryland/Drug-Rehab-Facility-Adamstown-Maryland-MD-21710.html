      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year.

      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use.Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.

Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
