      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown.
