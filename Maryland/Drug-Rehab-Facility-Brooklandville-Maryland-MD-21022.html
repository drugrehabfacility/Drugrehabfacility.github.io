      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another. In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible.

      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.

In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.
