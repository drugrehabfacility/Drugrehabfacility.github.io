      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. There are priority populations in many state rehab centers. 
      Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable.
