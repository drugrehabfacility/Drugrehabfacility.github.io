      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded.

      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county.

      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.
