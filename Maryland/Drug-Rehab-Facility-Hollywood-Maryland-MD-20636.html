      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 115 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday!

      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment.
