      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence.
