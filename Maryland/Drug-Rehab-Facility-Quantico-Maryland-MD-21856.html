      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. Detox centers in Connecticut provide: Around-the-clock care that ensures your safety if life-threatening symptoms of withdrawal arise. 
      We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped.
