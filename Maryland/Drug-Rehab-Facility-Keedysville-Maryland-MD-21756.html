      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well.

      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. Our goal is to help you break your chemical dependency as a safely and as comfortable as possible. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.
