      Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people.
