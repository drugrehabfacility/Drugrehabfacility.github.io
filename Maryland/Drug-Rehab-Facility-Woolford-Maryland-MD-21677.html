      While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      These individuals may not know that there are options for them. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. Drug Rehab Advisor insures when you attend a detox or rehab program you will get the detox withdrawal advice and services you expected. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.
