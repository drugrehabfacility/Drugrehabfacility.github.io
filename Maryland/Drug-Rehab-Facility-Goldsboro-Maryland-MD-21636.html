      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing.
