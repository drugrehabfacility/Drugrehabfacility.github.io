      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month.

      Preferred Family Healthcare, Quincy (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Otherwise known as “Recovery Resources,” the Quincy facility merged with Preferred Family Healthcare in July 2014. There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. The goal is to help you get mentally and physically stable. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures.
