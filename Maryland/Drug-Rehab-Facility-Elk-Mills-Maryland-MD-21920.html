      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free.
