      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad.
