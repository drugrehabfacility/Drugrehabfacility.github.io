      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. In many cases, the hospital-based unit refers you to complete the remaining portion of your drug addiction treatment at a free-standing addiction treatment program. 
      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. 
      The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals.
