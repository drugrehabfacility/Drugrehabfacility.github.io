      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. Expect wonderful add ons such as full suites, private rooms with private bathroom; standard rooms include use of internet, cell phones, prime locations, outstanding food and great supports. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. This allows the staff and the client to truly relate and get some really positive feedback and what steps need to be taken after detox to remain sober. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them.
