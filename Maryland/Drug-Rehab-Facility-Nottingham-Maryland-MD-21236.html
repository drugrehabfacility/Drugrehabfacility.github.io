      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role.
