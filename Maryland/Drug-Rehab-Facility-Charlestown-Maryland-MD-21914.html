      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues.

      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. 
      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program.
