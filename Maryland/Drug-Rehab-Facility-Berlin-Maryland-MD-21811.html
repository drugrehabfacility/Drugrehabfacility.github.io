      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol.
