      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions.
