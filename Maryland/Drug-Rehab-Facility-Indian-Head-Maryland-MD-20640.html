      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping.
