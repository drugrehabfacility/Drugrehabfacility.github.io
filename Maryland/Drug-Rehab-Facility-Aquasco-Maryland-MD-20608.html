      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. 
      One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction.
