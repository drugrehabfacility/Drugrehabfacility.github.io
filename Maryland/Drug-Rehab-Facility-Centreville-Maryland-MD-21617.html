      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence.
