      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      21% were admitted for alcohol rehab while the remaining for drug rehab. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.
