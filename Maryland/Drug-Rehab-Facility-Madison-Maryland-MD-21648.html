      An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. If you are dealing with an addiction, don't wait another day. [...If the patient lives in serbia, we provide the possibility of consultation where one will come to us and get free medical examination. 
      If you aren’t sure where or how to find these resources we can help though our find a meeting web application or getting you connected to what other resources you might be looking for. .
