      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470.

      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
