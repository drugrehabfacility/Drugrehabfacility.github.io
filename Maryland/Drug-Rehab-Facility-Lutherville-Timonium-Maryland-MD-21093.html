      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      C4 Community Counseling Centers, Chicago (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today C4 is a network of community counseling centers that provides aid and therapy for members of the community. When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context.

      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab.
