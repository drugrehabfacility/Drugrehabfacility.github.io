      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more.
