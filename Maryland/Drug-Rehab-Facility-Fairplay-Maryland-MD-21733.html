      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      If you want alcohol or drug detoxification for yourself or any of your family members then there are a good number of them in New Jersey. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal.
