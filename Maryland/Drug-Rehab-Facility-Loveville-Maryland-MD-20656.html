      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers. 
      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy.
