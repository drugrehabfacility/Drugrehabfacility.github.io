      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Correct healthy detox & withdrawal programs ensures that detox is wonderfully successful and healthy.
