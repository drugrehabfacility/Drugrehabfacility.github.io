      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      Our recommended integrative detox centers deliver more effective and sympathetic levels of care than Sierra Tucson, the Meadows or McLean Hospital to name a few. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs?

Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.She came back a minute later and said she showed everyone in the back kitchen area too, and that it made them all laugh and smile.
