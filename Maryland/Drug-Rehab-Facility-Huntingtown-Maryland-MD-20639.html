      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option.
