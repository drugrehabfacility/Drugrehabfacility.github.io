      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. This makes create seizures, stroke or may cause death. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Getting the right detox withdrawal advice will save your life. 
      Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Bar none, Detox of South Florida is the best care I have received.
