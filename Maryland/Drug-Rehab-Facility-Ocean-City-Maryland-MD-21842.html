      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change. Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. TASC inspires and introduces confident behavior changes with a lasting revitalization for those in corrections, criminal justice, juvenile justice, child welfare and public systems and they do have the Per Se standard for drugged driving which prohibits driving while under the influence of alcohol and any other combination of drug(s). 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms.

      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
