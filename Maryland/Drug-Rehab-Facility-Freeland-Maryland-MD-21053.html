      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.

      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery.
