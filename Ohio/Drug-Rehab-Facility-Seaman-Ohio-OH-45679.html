      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time.
