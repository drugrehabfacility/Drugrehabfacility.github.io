    <p>
      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      For a complete list of items we provide and items you should bring, please contact our Admissions team. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation.

      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. Many different Christian treatment methods exist ranging from twelve step methods to other faith-centered approaches to treatment. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. 
      Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others.
