      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.

      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission.

      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Getting the right detox withdrawal advice will save your life. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable.
