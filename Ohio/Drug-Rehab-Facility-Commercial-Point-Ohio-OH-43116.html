      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.
