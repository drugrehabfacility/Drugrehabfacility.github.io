      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. I am happy to be here and I know anyone that comes here will be happy too.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. 
      These individuals may not know that there are options for them.

      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens.
