      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.
