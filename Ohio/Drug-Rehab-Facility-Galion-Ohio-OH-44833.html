      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace.

      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
