      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case.Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV.They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests.
