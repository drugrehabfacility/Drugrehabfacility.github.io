      Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. 
      We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      The best method of detox is IV therapy medical detox.
