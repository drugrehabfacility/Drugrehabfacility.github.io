      Independent centers may use their own detox facilities when needed. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well.

      Some of these dangers can include seizures and even death. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. 
      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem.
