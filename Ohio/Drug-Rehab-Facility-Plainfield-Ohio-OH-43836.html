      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Maryland Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Between 2014 and 2015, Maryland’s rate of fatal drug overdose increased 20. This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs.
