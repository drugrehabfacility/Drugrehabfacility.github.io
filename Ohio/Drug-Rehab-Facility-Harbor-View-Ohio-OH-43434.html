      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs.
