      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse.
