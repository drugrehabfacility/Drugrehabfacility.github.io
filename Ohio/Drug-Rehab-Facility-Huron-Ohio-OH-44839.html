      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.
