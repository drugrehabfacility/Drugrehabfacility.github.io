      800-483-2193 Call the 24-HOUR ADDICTION Hotline RELATED PAGES Family is Forever!Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made.

      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.
