      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
