      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Drug addicts in Massachusetts are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Massachusetts.
