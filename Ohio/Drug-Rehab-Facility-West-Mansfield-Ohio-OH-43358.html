      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. Waiting Room Operating Room Recovery Room Recovery Room RDD Center performs our rapid drug detoxification procedure in a state-of-the-art, licensed surgical center providing patients effective results, superior care, safety, privacy and quality. 
      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
