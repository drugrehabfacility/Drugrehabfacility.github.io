      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation.

      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. After the individual continuously use heroin a tremendous negative effects may come up. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction.
