      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. 
      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.
