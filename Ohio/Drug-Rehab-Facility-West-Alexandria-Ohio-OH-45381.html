      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. 
      In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.

      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment.
