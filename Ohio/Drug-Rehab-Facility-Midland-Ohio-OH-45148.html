      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
