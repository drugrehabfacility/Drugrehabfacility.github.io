      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower.
