      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. 
      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. Serene Setting Panoramic windows, abundant natural light, and a soothing color palette promote well-being. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. 
      Give us a call and we’ll help you to find the perfect place for you in this wonderful state.
