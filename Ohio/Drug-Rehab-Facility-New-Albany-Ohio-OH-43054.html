      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms.

      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. However, many states can provide treatment that results in recovery and provides post-treatment support.   Who Qualifies?

      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
