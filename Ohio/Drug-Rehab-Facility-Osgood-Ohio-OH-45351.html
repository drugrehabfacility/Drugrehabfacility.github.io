      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Drug & Alcohol Detox Centers in New Jersey Find local treatment centers near your city. Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?
