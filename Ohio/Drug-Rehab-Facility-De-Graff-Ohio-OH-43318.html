      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Detox withdrawal advice may begin after doctors advices, hospital visits and personal attempts prove ineffective. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system.
