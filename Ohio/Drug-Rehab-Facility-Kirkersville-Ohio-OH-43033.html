      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use.

      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure.

      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
