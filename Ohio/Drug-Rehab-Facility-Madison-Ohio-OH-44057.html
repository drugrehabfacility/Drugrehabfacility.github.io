      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs.
