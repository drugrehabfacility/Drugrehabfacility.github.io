      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.

      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.

      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more.Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.

      The healthcare professional assures that the prescription of the medicine is within an inferior volume.
