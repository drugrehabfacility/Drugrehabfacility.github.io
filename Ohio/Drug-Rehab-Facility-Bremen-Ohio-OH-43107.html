      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. 
      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission.
