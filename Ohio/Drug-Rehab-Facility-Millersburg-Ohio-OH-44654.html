      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Call Now (888) 365-2740 Questions about treatment? 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
