    <p>
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.

      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. 
      Successful Detox: This means you'll get the most care from integrative holistic and medical detox providers who specialize in natural care methods. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction.

That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.
