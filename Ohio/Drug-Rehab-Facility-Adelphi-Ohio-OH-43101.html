      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways.

      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great.
