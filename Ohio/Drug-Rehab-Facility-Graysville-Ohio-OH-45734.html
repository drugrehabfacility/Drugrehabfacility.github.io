      Advocate Addiction Treatment Center, Des Plaines (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today For those who need medical help for a problem with substance abuse, it does not come better than one that is provided by a hospital. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Therefore the right detox withdrawal advice gives you a new lease on life. 
      Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
