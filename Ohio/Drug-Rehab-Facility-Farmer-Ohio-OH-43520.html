      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free.
