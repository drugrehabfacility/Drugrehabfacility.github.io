      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check.
