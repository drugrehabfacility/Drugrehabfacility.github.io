      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Personal events, trauma and the environment does affect drug use. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.
