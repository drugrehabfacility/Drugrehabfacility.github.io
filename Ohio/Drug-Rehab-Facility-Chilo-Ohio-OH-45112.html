      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need.
