      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.
