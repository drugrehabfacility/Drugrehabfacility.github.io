      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions.
