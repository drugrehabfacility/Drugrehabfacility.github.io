      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal.
