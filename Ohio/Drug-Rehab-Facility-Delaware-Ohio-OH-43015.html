      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support.
