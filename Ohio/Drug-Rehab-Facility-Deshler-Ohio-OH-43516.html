      Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.

      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs.
