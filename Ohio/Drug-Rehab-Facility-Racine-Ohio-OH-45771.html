      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.
