      There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage.
