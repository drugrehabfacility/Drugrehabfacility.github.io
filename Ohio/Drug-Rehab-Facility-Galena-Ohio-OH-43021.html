      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      Amphetamine Withdrawal Symptoms – Often the least severe type of withdrawal users of amphetamines like methamphetamine, cocaine and prescriptions like Ritalin and Adderall experience symptoms like excessive sleeping and eating, depression, mood swings, paranoia and anxiety.
