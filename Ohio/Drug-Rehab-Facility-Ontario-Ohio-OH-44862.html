      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
