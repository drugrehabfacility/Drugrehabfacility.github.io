      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      While less common, cocaine, sedatives, and hallucinogens were also reasons for seeking out drug treatment in Nevada. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition.
