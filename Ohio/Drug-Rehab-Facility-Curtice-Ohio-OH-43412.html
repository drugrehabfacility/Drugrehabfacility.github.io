      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Our addiction specialists can assess your recovery needs and help you get the addiction treatment that provides the best chance for your long-term recovery.Easy drug detox is a successful method of drug detoxification.
