    </p>
    <p>
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. You will Detox with Dignity at the Toms River treatment center.
