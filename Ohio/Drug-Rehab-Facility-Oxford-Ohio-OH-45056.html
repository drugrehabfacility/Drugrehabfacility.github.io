      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer.
