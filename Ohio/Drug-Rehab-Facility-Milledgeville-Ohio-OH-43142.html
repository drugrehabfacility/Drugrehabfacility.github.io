      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you.
