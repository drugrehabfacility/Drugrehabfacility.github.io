While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die.
