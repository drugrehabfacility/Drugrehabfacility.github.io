      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally.
