      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      The medical approach to detoxing can be useful for a number of different substances. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches.
