      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. The doctors in the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts will help you from quitting heroin used. 
      The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      When the person admits to heroin detox, they should accept that they need to stay inside the center until the moment that they recover. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.
