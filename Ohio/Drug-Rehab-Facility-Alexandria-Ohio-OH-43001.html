      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! If you have any problem while you are here, the techs and Kevin help resolve the issue in a professional manner. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body.
