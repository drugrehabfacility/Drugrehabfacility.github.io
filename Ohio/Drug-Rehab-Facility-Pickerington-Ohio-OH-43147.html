      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them. 
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. With so much contrast and such a tourist-driven city at the state’s core, it comes as no surprise that people in the Nevada area do have their fair share (and sometime more than their fair share) of challenges and struggles. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
