      Rapid Detox Versus Traditional Detox Free Detox Centers Some people just can’t afford any type of treatment for their addiction. 
      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).
