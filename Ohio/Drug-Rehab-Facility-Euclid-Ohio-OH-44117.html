      Just call us today at (513) 914-4554.  WE ACCEPT MOST MAJOR INSURANCE AND PRIVATE PAY CLIENTS.36 Ohio Inpatient Alcohol and Drug Rehab Centers Ohio is one of the Great Lake States and traditionally a major manufacturing center, home to many historic cities and events in American history. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.
