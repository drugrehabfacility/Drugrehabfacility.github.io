      Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control.
