      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism.If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
