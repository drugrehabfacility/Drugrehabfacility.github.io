      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.

      31% of all fatal crashes involve Alcohol impairment. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else.
