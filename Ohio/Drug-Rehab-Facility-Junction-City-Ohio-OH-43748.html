      Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox.
