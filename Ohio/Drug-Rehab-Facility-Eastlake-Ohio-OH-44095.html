      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them.Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.

Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state.

      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox.
