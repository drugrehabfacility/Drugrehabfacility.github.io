      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.

      If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
