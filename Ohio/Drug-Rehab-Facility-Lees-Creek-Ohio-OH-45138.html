      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs?

      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone.
