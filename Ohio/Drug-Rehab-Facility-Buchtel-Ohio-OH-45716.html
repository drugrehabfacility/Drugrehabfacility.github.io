      Rather, we offer an educational cognitive behavioral education program that helps you identify the habits that led you to choose drugs and help you create different habits and a more fulfilling and satisfying lifestyle. 
      Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. Our in-house program allows the medical team to begin working to improve your life in a drug-free environment. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.
