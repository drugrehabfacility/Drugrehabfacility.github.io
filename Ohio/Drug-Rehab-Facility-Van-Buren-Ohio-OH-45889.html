      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Drug Free Detox Alternatives Drug free detox is an effective method to get someone completely off of drugs. 
      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions.

      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.

      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. 
      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Drug And Alcohol Detox Centers Drug and alcohol detoxification is one of the first steps in the treatment process toward recovery from drug and alcohol addiction.It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens.
