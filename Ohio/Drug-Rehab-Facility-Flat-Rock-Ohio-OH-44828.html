      Beckett Springs, Beckett Ridge (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Beckett Springs is a 48-bed behavioral hospital that offers outpatient and inpatient mental health and addiction treatment for adults and their families. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.
