    </p>
    <p>
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be.
