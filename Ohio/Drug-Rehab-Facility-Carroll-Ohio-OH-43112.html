      You may not feel ready to give up drugs and alcohol. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Let us help find the right treatment center for you, so you can start living a better life.
