      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. Quick drug detoxification allows us to clean the receptors completely. 
      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol.

      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab.
