      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. 
      The Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts explains below the reasons for this: The Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts purpose this process to cleanse the body of the involve person. The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.

      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of.
