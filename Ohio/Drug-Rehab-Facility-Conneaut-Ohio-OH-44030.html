      In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Along with this, emotional and psychological support is provided to the victims. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
