      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab.
