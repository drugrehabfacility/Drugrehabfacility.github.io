      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. 
      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.

During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects.
