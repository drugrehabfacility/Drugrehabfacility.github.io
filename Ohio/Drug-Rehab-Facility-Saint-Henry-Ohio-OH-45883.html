      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.

      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      The Ohio detox centers provide a combination of both detox and psychotherapeutic treatments thereby giving effective treatments to break free from addiction. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
