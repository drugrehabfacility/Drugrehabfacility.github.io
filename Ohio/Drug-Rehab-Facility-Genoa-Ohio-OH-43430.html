      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program.Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication.Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
