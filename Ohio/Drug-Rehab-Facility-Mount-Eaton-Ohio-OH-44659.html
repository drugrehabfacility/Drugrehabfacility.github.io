      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions.
