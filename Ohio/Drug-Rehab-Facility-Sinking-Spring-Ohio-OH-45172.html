      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. Methadone detox centers provide professional medical care to assist those addicted to methadone with their first phase of recovery—detoxification. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.
