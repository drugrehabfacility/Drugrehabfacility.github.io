      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
