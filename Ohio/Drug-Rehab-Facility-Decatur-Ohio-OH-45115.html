Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms.

      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences.
