      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 5210 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 9 months Ago Salute to moms!

Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.

      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.

      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
