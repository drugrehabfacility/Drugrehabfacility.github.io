      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process.

      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required.
