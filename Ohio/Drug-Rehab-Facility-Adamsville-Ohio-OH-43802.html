      Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week! 
      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. If you need alcohol for your body to feel normal, then you likely need help. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
