      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      If you are in need of immediate assistance, please call our toll-free number and we will help you 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome.
