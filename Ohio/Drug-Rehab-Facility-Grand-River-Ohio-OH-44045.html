      Narcotics Anonymous: A 12-step support group program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. I've dedicated my life to helping others gain health and happiness.

      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better.

      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7.
