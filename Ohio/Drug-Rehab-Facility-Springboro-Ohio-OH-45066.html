      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. 
      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing.
