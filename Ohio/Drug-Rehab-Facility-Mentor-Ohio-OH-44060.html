Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Excellent detox which rejuvenates life is essential to make significant gains in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse.

      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe.
