      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.
