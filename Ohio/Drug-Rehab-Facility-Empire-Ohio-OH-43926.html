      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Costs range from $20,000 / month to $50,000 / month. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Expect wonderful add ons such as full suites, private rooms with private bathroom; standard rooms include use of internet, cell phones, prime locations, outstanding food and great supports. Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. 
      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs.

      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Timberline Knolls, Lemont (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Aimed specifically at women, Timberline Knolls is a residential treatment center that helps with substance abuse as well as other issues such as trauma and PTSD, mood disorders, and eating disorders. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment.
