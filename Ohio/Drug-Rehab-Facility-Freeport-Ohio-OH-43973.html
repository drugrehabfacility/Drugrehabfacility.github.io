      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
