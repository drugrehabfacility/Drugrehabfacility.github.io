      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. Illinois & Drug Abuse Alcoholism is a sneaky illness. 
      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
