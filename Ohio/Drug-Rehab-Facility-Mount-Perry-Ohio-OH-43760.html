      Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns. Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. 
      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.

      The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another. 
      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well.
