      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. 
      In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.

      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more.
