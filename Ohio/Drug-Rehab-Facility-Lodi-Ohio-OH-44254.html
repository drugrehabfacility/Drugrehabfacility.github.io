      Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems. 
      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths.

      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches.
