      69656 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 7 months Ago An unthinkable tragedy occurred at the Boston Marathon today. 
      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. Medical detox treatment includes detox through medication. 
      Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.
