      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.
