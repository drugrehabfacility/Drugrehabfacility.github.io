      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment. While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees.

      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts.
