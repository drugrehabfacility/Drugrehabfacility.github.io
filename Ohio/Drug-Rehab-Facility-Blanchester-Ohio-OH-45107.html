      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed.

      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.
