      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. 
      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking.

      If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment? 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur.

      Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois.Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself.
