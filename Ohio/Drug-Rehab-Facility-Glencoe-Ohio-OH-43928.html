      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Inpatient Rehab Centers in Ohio Offer Your Best Chance at Recovery from Addiction To meet the crisis of higher rates of substance abuse, Ohio’s inpatient rehab centers offer the latest rehabilitation science techniques and therapies.

      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.
