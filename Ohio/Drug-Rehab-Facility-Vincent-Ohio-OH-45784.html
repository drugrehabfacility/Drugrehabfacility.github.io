      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.
