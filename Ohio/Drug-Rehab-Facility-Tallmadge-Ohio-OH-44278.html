Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though.
