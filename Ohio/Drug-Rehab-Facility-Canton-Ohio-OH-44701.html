      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      Counseling Individual and group counseling is used to identify the underlying issues that led to a client’s addiction. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. Patients are given sedation if needed and IV vitamin infusions. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.
