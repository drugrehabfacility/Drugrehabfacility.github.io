      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl?
