      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility.
