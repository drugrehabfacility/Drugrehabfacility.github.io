      Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.
