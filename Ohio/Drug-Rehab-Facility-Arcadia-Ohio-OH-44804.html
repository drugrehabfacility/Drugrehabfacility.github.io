      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts.
