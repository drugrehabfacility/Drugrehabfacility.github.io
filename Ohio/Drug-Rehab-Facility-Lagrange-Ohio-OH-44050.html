      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers. 
      I also have some high level centers which deliver an abundance of treatment at about 1/2 to 2/3 the costs of comparable programs. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals.
