      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Like vomiting, irritation, nausea, nostril, chill. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      In the each situation I have learned "from you" to look at the positive, in everything however small it may seem. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
