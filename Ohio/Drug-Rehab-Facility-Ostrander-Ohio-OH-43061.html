      Facing Drug and Alcohol Addiction in Ohio Ohio has delivered many treasures to the United States. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. Cincinnati actually boasts the largest Oktoberfest celebration outside of Germany with all types of cultural booths, exhibits, traditional attire, and delectable German delicacies to dine upon. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
