      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment? 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. She came back a minute later and said she showed everyone in the back kitchen area too, and that it made them all laugh and smile. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.

      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.
