      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time.

      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program.
