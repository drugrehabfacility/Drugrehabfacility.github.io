      Ongoing assistance for a seamless transition into rehab. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.
