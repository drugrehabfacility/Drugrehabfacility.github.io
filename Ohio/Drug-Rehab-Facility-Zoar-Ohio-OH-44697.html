      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center.

      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>

    <p>
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Paying for Treatment Ultimately, paying for amphetamine rehab in Ohio is a matter of accessing available health insurance options or using your existing health plan. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal.
