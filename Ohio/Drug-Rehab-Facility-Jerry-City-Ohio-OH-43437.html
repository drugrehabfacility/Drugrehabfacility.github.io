      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years.

      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings.

      It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Call now to be connected with a compassionate treatment specialist.

      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Natural Drug Detox Programs Naturally overcoming physical drug dependence is another method of detox that can be very effective and liberating at the same time.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more.Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs.

      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body.
