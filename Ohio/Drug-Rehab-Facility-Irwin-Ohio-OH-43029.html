      Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. 
      They are searching for the same high that the pills gave them. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.

      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.

      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future.Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. 
      Inpatient detox programs address the symptoms of drug detox as the occur, and prevent serious complications. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program.

      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.
