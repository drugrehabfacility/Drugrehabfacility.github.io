As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      Many of these programs are free of charge, but not all of them, so individuals should confirm before getting involved.   What Is Included in Free Drug Rehab? Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table.
