      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
