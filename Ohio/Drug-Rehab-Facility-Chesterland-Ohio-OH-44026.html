      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable.

This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming.
