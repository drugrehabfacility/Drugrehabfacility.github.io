      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox.
