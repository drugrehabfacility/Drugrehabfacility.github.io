      Drug Addiction </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse.
