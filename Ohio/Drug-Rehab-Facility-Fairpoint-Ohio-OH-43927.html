      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed.

      Finding Substance Abuse Treatment In Illinois Illinois has such deep and rich history within the United States, spanning from the historic Route 66 running through the state, to the iconic memorials of Abraham Lincoln.

      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox.
