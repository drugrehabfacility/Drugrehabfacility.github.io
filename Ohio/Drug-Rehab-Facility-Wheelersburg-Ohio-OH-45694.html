      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours.

      Opiate addiction is killing thousands of people every year. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab.

      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence.The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
