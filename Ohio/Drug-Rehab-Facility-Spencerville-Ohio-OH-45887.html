      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015. 
      Fortunately, Ohio detox centers offer treatments that can help individuals overcome physical dependency on heroin, opioids, alcohol, and all other substances. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Holistic program options are also available in Ohio.
