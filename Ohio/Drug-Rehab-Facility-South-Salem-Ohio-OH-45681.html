      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. If this is the case, there’s no better time to get needed treatment help than now since amphetamine addiction tends to get worse with time. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs.
