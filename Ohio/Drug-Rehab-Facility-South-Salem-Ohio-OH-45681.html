      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process.
