      New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      But in recent decades, Ohio’s has shifted from a manufacturing to service economy, causing much unemployment and economic upheaval. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause.

      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. 
      In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
