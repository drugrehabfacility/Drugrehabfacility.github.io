      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. 
      Ohio is a state that represents all that people expect from the Midwest. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin.
