Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox.
