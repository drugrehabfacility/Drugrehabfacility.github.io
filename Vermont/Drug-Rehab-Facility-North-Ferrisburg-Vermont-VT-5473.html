      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.

      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse.
