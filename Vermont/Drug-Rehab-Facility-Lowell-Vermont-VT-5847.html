      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. 
      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis.

      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. 
      Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions.
