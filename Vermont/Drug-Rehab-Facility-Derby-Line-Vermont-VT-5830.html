      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery.
