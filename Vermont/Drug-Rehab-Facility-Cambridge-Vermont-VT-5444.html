      While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics.

      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances.

      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. All care providers should be appropriately licensed and credentialed. 
      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach.
