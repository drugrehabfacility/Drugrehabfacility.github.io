Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient.It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Your love and support is needed to help the person survive.
