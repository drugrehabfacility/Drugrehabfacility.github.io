      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Over 91% of people in Ohio who struggle with alcohol abuse do not seek or receive treatment.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. 
      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy.
