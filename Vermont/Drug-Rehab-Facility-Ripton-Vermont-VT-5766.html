      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end.
