      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. 
      You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. Simply put, the treatment program uses different disciplines with planning and purpose. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug.

      There are also other types of programs available that incorporate many modalities to achieving sober success for a lifetime.Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. 
      No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. 
      From patient from abroad, there is a preliminary part in which the patient sends us the information for his case via e-mail. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. 
      Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.
