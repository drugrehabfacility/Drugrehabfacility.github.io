      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab.Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Ohio detox centers can prescribe FDA-approved medications that reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms to enhance your recovery. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function.

      Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.

      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have.
