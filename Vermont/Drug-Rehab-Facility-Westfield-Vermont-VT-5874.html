      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland.The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive.
