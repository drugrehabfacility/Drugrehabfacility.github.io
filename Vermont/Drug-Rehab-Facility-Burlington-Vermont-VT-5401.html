      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      This treatment program usually lasts for a Fairview UT 84629 period of 30-90 days. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.
