Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms.

      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful.
