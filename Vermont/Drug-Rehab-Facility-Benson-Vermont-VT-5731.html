      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction.

      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.

      It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better.
