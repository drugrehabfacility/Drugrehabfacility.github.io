      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage.

      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions.
