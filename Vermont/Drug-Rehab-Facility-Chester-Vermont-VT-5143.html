      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      The Affordable Care Act (ACA) classifies treatment for substance use disorders as one of the 10 essential health benefits and requires that plans purchased through the national healthcare Marketplace cover addiction and drug dependence treatments that often include detox. Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. 
      Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency.
