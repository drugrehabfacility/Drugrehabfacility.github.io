      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      The healthcare professional assures that the prescription of the medicine is within an inferior volume. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery.
