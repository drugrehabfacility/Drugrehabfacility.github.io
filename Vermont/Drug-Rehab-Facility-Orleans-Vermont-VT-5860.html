      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
