      Opiate Detox Centers One of the most dangerous and most addictive classes of drugs available today is the opiate. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      If you’re seeking intervention resources, want to learn more about our programs or seek help for a loved one, contact us.

      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever.

      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward.
