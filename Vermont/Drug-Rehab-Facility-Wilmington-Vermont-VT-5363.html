      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
