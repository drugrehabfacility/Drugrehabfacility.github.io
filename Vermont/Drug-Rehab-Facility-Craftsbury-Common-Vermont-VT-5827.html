      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. 
      The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.

Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      Opiate detox centers specialize in helping patients who are addicted to opiates and can provide profound treatment measures to assist the recovering addict in their plight against opiate addiction.
