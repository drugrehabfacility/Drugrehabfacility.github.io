Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease. 
      There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
