      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      About 40 percent of accidental injury deaths among Illinois residents are related to Alcohol use. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher.
