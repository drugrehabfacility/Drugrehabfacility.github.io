      Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse.
