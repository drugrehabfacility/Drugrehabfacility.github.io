      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. More than 10% of all heroin overdose deaths that occurred in the U. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems.
