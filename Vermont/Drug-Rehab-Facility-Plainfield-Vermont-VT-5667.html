      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab. 
      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad.
