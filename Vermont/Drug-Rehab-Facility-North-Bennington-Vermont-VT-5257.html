      Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs. 
      There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps.

      Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better.
