      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.

      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Make sure to test out what they say and see what makes you joyful. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance.
