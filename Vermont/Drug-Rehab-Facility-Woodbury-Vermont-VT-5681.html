      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. 
      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. 
      If you have any queries or concerns about our detox process, call us now at (201) 549-8050. Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own.
