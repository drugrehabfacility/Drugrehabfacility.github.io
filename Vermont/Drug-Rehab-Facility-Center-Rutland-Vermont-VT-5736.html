      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive.

      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.

Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Independent centers may use their own detox facilities when needed.
