      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      Support to help you remain mentally focused on your recovery.
