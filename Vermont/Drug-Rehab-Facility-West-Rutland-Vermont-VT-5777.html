      It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again.
