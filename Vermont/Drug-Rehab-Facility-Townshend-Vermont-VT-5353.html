      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school.

      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting.The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.
