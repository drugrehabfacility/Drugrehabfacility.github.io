      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year.
