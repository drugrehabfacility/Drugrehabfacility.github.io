      Both inpatient and outpatient centers offer medical and nonmedical treatment. 
      Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy.
