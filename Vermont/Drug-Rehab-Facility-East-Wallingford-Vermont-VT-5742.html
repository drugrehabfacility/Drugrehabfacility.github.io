      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. 
      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one.Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs. 
      Call our #Pennsylvania detox specialists today to learn more. Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs.

      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
