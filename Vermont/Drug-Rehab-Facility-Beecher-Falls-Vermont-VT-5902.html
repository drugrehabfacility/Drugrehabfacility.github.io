      This is usually only recommended (or even permitted) when there is a grave medical danger present, either due to the amounts being abused or the extreme risks associated with the withdrawal. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox.
