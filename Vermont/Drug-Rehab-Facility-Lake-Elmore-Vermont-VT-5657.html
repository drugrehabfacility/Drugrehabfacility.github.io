      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
