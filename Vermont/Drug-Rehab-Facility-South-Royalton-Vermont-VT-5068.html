And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked.

      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. How can I choose the best among drug detox centers in Chicago? 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol.
