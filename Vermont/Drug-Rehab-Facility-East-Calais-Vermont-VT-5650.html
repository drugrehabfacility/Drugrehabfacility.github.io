      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient.
