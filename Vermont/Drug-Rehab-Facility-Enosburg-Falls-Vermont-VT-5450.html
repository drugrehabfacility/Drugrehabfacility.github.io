      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Independent centers may use their own detox facilities when needed. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room.

      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction.
