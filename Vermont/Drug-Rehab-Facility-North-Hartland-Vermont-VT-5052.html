      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use?
