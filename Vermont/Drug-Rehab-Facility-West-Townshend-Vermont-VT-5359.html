Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Each person who has to go through the detox facilities in Washington just wants someone who cares while also somehow managing to beat the discomfort of the physical withdrawal from opiates, benzos, alcohol, cocaine and more. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      For the person interested in history and heritage, Cincinnati’s culture was largely influenced by the large numbers of German and Irish immigrants who settled the area. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction.
