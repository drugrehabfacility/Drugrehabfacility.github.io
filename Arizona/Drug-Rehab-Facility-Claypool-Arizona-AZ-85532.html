Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery.

      If you need alcohol for your body to feel normal, then you likely need help. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      Places for drug and alcohol treatment centers are close by with more facilities opening at record pace. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing.
