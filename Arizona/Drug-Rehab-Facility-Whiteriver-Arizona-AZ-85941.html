      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
