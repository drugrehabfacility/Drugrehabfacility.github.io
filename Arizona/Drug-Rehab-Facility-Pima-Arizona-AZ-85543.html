      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time.

      Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking.
