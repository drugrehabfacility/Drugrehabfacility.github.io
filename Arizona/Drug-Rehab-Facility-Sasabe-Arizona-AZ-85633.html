      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
