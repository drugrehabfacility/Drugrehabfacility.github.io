      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally.
