      Get Listed in Our Directory Are you a treatment center who specializes in opioid addiction treatment through the use of Buprenorphine or other methods? While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery.
