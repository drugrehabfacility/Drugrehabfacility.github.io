      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015.

      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Their staff is comprised of medical professionals as well as recreational therapists, yoga instructors, and nutritionists, all working together to insure that each client has a full and rounded recovery. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital.
