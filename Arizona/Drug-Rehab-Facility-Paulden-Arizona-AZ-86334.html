      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong.
