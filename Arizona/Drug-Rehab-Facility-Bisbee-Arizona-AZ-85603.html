      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor.
