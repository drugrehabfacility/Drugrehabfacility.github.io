      During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. Find medical detox centers in your area by contacting us toll-free via phone, chat or email. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.
