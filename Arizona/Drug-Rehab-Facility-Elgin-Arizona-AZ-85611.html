      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many.
