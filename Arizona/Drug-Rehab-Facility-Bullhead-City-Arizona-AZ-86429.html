      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs.

      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage.
