      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. 
      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse.
