      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere. 
      Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.
