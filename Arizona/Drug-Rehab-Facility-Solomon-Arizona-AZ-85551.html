      Natural Drug Detox Programs Naturally overcoming physical drug dependence is another method of detox that can be very effective and liberating at the same time. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.
