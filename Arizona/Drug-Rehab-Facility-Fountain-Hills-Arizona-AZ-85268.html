      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. For more information on this facility go to www.glenbeigh.com/niles 6. 
      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.
