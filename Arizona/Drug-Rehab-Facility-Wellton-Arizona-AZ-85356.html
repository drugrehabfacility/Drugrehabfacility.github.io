      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care.
