      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.

      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
