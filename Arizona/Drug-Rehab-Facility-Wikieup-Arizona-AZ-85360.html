      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Detox withdrawal advice may begin after doctors advices, hospital visits and personal attempts prove ineffective. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.
