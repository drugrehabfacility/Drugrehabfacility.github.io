      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.

      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.

      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse.
