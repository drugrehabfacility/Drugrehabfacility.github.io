      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that.

      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days.
