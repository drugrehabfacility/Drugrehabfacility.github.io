      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. 
      We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey.
