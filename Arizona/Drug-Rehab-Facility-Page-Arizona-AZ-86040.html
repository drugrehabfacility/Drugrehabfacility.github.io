An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life.
