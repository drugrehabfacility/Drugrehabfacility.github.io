      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. The most common reason that people seek out treatment from a drug detox center in the state of Nevada is for stimulant abuse and addiction, namely meth (methamphetamine). 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy.
