      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Don’t fall victim to this statistic, call 800-483-2193 today and we’ll connect you with a detox specialist that can answer your questions and help you find a center that’s able to assist in your recovery process. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms.

      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. Rapid Drug Detox Center benchmarks the quality of care to ensure it is higher than the national standard and the best in the nation. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
