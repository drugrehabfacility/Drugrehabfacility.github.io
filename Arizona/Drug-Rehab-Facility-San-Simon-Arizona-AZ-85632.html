      Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now.

Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance.

      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important.

      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. These centers usually require that the clients qualify through proving: Official residence in the state, based on the state’s definition Lack of income and insurance Legal residence in the US Addiction status and need for intervention Depending on the state, there may be other requirements before the individual can be accepted into the treatment program. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. All in-patient detox centers offer medically supervised care by either medical professionals closely monitoring a detox or by holistic detox specialists providing 24/7 attention under the guidance of detox doctors. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
