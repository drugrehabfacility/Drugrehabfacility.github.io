      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction.
