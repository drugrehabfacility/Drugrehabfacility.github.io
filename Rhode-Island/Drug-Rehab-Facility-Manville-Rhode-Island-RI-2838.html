      They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions.
