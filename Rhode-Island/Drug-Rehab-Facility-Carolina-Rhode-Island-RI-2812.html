      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.

      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Types of Treatment Available Drug rehabilitation is addressed through various Fairview UT 84629 programs which include; use of local support groups, addiction counseling, medical care, residential treatment, extended care givers, mental health, recovery houses and orthomolecular medicine.

The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects.
