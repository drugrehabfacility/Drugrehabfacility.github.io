      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. 
      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal.
