    <p>
      Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. 
      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. 
      We have access to the most efficient drug and alcohol Detox centers in the country. Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.
