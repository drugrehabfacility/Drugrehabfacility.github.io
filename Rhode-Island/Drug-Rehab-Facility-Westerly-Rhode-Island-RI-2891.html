      I am grateful for this facility and hope anyone in need of detox chooses this place. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.
