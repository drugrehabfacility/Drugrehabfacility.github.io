      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
