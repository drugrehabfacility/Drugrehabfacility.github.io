      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Opiate detox centers specialize in helping patients who are addicted to opiates and can provide profound treatment measures to assist the recovering addict in their plight against opiate addiction. 
      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.
