      There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. Drug addicts in Connecticut are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Connecticut. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse.5 percent of admissions were for both alcohol and drug abuse and 45 percent were for drug use only. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. 
      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake.They should e ready on the process that they will have especially for the withdrawal stages that they will experience. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope.
