      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. 
      Detox may occur in any of the following settings: Inpatient detox Hospital detox Outpatient detox Medical detox Choosing to get help at one of the many detox centers in Illinois is your first step toward healing and sobriety. Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.

      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. Many people find themselves from hooked on this kind of substances. 
      Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Natural Drug Detox Programs Naturally overcoming physical drug dependence is another method of detox that can be very effective and liberating at the same time. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.
