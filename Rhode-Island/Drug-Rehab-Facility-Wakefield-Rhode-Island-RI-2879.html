      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Once under general anesthesia and deep sedation, the opiate antagonist is administered and also a strict formula of medications specifically designed to flush out the patients opiate receptors.
