      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.
