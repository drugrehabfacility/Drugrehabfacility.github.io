      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities.
