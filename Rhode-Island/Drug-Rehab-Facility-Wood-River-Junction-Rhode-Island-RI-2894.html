      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.
