      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. You should have the actual desire to be back to the strong person you know you deserve to be, and all you have to do is get over this ugly step and there will be such an amazing future for you, something you can’t even imagine. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.

      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail.

      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
