      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Excellent detox which rejuvenates life is essential to make significant gains in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction.
