      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.

Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. 
      Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. 
      21% were admitted for alcohol rehab while the remaining for drug rehab. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given.
