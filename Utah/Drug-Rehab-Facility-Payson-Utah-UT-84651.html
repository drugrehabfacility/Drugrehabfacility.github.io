      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). This will make finding exactly what you need at the nearest drug detox center facility to your family. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.
