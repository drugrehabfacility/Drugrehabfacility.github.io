      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery.
