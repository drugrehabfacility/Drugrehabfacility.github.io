      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      We can help you keep your obligations to your spouse, employer, and children by providing you with effective and convenient outpatient services, and by leading you onto the path of an addiction free life. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.

      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.

      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Group Therapy: Drug use and addiction turns many addicts into introverted isolationists. Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.
