      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      These pharmaceutical drugs are designed to blunt the effects of the physical withdrawal symptoms that can make regular detox so difficult. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      Ohio Drug & Alcohol Rehab While no single treatment works for every person, a unique process will be created for you. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal.
