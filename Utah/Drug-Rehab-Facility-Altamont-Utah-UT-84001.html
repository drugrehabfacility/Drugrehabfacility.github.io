      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.
