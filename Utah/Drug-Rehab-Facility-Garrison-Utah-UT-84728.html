      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
