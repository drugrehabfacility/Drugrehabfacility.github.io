      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. 
      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
