      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. 
      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction.
