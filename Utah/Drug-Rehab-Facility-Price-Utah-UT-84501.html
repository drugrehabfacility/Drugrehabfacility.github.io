      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.

      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      Drug rehabilitation involves the following types of behavioral therapy; Cognitive behavioral therapy: helps patients know, avoid and bear with situations which may make them return to their addiction habits.
