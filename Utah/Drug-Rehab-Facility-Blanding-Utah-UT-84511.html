      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
