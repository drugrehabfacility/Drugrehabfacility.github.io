      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
