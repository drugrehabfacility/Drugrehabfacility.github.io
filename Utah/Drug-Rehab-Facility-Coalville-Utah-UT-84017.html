      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient. There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
