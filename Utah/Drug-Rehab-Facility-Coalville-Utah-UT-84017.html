      Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. 
      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 
      We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction.
