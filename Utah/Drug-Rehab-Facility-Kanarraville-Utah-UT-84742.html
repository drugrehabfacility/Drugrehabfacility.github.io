      There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process.

Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox.
