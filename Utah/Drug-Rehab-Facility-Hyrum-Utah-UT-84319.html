      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
