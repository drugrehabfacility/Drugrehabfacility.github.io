      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. 
      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. TASC inspires and introduces confident behavior changes with a lasting revitalization for those in corrections, criminal justice, juvenile justice, child welfare and public systems and they do have the Per Se standard for drugged driving which prohibits driving while under the influence of alcohol and any other combination of drug(s). 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. After the initial round of treatment, the facility may offer a number of other options, including group therapy, family involvement and learning coping skills. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.
