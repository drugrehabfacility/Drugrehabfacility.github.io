      Opiate Addiction Treatment </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. 
      Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible.
