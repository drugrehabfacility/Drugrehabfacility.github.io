      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
