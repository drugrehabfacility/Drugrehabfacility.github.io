      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      Quick drug detoxification allows us to clean the receptors completely. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
