      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.

While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated.
