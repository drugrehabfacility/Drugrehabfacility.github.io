      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery.
