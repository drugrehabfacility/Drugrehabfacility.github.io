      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems.

      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer.
