      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.

      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
