Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment.
