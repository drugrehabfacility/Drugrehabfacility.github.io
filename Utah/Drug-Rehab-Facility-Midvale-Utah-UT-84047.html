      800-483-2193 Rapid Detox Centers A relatively new method of assisting those who are addicted to opiates in overcoming the physical dependence that they suffer from is the rapid detox method. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
