      At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable.

      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. It might be worth checking your computer for viruses with an antivirus utility such as CureIt from «Dr. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
