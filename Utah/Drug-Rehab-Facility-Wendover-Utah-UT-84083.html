      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs? Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures.
