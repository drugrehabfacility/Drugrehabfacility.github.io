      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time.

      Drug Detox 
      Treatment </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. By analyzing this information, we give an answer with the treatment plan and cost of medical services that would be appropriate for that case. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs.
