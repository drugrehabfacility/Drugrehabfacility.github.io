      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.

All of those who are involved directly with the recovering addict will also benefit from their attendance in a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug.
