      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. Drug detox methods are used for those taking most forms of prescriptions as well as illicit drugs. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. These scholarships are often offered through private treatment facilities or through organizations concerned with helping those who are struggling with addiction. 
      At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
