      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. Staffed with experienced professionals, Cleveland Clinic is one of many excellent residential drug rehab facilities you can find throughout Ohio.
