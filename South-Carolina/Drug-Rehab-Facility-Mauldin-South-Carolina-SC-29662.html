      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective.

      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Smiling is considered infectious, so keep on smiling! Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.

      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. About 40 percent of accidental injury deaths among Illinois residents are related to Alcohol use. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals.And I’m sure Arianna brightened up at least one of the employees days with her silly little personality.
