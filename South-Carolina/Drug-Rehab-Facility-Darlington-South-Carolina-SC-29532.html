      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Some are also given sleep medications and anti-anxiety drugs.
