      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction.

      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.
