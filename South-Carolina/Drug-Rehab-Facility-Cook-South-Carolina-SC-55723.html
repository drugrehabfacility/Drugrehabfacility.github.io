      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Recovering from addiction at a detox center will also lower your risk for relapse, since you’ll learn tips and tricks for avoiding and handling real-life situations that could lead to alcohol and drug use. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive.
