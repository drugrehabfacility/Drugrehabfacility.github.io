      It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015.

      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Finding these centers is often just a matter of talking to the leaders of these faith traditions to connect with the resources.
