      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      It is only when BOTH of these components have been addressed that the individual can move forward and live a happy, fulfilling life – maintaining their sobriety in the months and years after rehab.
