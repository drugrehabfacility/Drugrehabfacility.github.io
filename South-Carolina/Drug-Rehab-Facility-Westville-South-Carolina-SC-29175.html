      A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. 
      Each individual insurance plan is different, and insurance can greatly help to defray the potential costs.
