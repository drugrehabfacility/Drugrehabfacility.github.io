      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
