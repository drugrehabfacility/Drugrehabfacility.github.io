Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again.

This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana.
