      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction.
