      115 Alpha Center chesterfield,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday! An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well. This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. 
      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now.
