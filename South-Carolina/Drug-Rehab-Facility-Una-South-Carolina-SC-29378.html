      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency.
