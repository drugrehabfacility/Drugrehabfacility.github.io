      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. 
      A successful attempt at quitting depends on ability to locate drug detox centers run to scientific principles, ones that recognize detox as one step of an involved in ongoing process. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab.

      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
