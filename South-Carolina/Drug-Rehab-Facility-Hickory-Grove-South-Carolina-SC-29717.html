      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab.
