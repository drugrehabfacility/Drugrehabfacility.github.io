      Our detoxification and drug treatment programs are designed by highly experienced medical professionals, who adhere to a strict ethical and procedural code that guarantees your confidentiality, as well as your safety. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. Contact us for more information at (855) 933-0707 or search for a location in your area.Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers What is a Medical Detox? 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being.
