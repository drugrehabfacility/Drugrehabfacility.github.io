      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. This session can e a group or individual session. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. We can help you determine what option is best for you.
