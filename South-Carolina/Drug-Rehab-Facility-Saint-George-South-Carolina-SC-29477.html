CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. 
      A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety.
