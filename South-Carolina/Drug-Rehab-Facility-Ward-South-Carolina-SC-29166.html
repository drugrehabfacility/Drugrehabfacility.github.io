      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation.
