      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. About 40 percent of accidental injury deaths among Illinois residents are related to Alcohol use. 
      Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition.
