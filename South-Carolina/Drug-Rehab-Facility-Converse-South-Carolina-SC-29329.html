      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease.
