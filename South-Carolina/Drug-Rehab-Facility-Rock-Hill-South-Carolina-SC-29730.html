      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      Our specialists will connect you with a detox facility where you'll receive high-quality detox care tailored to your individual needs.
