      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription.

      The issue isn’t so much that they aren’t aware of the problems, but rather that the problem is that that is the nature of addiction. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction.
