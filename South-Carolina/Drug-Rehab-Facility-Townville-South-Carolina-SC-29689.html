      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. 
      In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. When the person admits to heroin detox, they should accept that they need to stay inside the center until the moment that they recover.
