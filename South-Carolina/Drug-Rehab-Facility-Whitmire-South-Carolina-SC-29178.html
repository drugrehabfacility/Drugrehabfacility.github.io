IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening.
