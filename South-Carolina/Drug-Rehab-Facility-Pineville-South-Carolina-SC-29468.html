      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. Counseling results to intervention which involves seeking professional help by the concerned parties to give the patient the necessary treatment. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.

      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances.
