      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. 
      These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox.
