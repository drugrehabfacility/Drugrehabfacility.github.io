      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois.
