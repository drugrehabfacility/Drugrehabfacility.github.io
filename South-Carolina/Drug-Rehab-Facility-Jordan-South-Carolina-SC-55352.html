      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 115 Alpha Center chesterfield,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday! 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given.
