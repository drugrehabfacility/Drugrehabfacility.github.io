      My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox.

      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night.
