      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete.
