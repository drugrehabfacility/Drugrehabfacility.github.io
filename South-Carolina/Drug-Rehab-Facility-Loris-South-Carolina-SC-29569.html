      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night.People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad.
