      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Arianna, my little sister, didn’t waste any time when our waitress, Lauren, greeted us at our table.Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Most of the times the medication given at detox facilities in Washington are a safety matter because some withdrawal symptoms can be fatal. They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      You will Detox with Dignity at the Toms River treatment center.Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again.

      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      If you're sad because somebody you love has an issue with alcohol or drugs, you don't have to suffer alone.
