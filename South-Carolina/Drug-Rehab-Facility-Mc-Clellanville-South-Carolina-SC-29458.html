      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. 
      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is.
