      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. 
      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.
