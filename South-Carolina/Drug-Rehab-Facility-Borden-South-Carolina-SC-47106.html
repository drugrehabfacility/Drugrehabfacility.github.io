      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.

      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. With all these great things going on in the Buckeye state, it’s hard to imagine that a large number of Ohio residents die each year due to drug-overdoses. 
      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation.

Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.
