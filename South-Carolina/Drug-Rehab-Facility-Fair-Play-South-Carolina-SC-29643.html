Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.

Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).
