      6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. 
      During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances.

      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug.

      This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.
