      S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs.
