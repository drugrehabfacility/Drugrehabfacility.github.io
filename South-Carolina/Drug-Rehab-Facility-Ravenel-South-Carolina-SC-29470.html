      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage.
