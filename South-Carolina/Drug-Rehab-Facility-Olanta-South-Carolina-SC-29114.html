      Rapid Drug Detox Center benchmarks the quality of care to ensure it is higher than the national standard and the best in the nation. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms. It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.
