However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.

In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped.

Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.
