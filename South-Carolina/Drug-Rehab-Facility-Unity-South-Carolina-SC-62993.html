      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. You do not have to leave the city to address your needs or the specialized needs of your near and dear ones.
