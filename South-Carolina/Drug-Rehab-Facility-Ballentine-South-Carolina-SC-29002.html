      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program.
