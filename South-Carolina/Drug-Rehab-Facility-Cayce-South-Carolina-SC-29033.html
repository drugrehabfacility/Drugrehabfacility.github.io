      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.

      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol.
