      Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.
