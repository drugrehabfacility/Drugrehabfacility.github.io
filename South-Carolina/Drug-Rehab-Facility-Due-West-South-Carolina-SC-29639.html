      Several such natural withdrawal processes are used to comfortably re-balance the body’s chemistry by assisting it in returning to proper function. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.

      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against.

      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.
