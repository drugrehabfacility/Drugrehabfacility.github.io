      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks. 
      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there.

      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Outpatient detox centers are not for those who have extremely physical addictions which can pose a threat to the patient when they abruptly stop using the substances such as alcohol or heroin.
