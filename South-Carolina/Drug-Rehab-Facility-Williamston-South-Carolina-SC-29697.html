      Group Therapy: Drug use and addiction turns many addicts into introverted isolationists. Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Practicing kindness is as simple as helping the someone take groceries to the car. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.
