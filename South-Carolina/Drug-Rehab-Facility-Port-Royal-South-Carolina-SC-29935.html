      It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      How long have they been dependent on drugs / medications?

      Please tell Kathy she is great, and made a big difference for me. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Don’t think that you can’t get back to living a happy & healthy life If you have nowhere or nobody else to turn to, then now is the time to call us for help. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery.
