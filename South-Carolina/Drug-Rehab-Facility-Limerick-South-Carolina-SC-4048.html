      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. These pharmaceutical drugs are designed to blunt the effects of the physical withdrawal symptoms that can make regular detox so difficult. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.
