      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. 
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. 
      Those executive level centers have been selected which meet and exceed expectations.
