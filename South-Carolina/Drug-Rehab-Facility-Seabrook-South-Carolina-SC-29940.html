      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab.

      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation.
