      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process!

      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).

      The rehab program you choose will help you determine the best course of action for your particular addiction. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox.
