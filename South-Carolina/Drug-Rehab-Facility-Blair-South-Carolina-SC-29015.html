      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.
