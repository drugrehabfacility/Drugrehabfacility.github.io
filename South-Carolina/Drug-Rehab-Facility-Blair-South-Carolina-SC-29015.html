Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. Whether you’re having nausea or you feel like you need someone to speak with, our professionals will be there for you. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms.

      Our specialists will connect you with a detox facility where you'll receive high-quality detox care tailored to your individual needs. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process.
