      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Center for Addiction Treatment, Cincinnati (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Center for Addiction Treatment is just that–a place where individuals can go to begin or work on their recovery. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.

      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
