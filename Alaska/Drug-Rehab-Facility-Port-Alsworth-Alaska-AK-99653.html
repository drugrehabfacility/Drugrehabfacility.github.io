      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. Christian Detox Centers Patients who find strength through their spirituality can benefit from christian detox centers. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment.
