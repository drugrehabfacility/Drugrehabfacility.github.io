      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. Outpatient Drug Detox Outpatient programs provide high-level care for those needing a flexible schedule. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment? 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now. I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. 
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction.
