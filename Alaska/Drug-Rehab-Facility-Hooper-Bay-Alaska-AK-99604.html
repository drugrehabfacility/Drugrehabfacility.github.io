      Alcohol detox in Ohio can last as little as three or four days, or up to several weeks for those fighting a severe or long-term addiction. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store.
