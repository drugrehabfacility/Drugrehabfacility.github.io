      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. 
      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. All of those who are involved directly with the recovering addict will also benefit from their attendance in a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred.
