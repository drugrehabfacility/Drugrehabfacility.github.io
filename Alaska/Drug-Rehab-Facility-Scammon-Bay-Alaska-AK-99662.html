      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      Don’t think that you can’t get back to living a happy & healthy life If you have nowhere or nobody else to turn to, then now is the time to call us for help. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department.

      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.

      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction.
