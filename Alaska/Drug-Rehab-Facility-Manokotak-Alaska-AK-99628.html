      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. 
      Perhaps it could be discussed as a loan that the individual can work to pay back over time. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time.
