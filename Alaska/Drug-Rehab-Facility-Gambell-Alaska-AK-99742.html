      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy: Your addiction didn’t happen in a vacuum. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs.It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so.
