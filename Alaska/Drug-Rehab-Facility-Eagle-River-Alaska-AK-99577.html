It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer.

Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms.
