      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse.Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions.

      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built.
