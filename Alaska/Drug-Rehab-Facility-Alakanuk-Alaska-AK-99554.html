      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. 
      Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy.
