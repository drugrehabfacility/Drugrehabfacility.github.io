      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Medical Detox Centers Many hospitals and residential treatment facilities provide medical detox centers as part of their overall treatment regimen.
