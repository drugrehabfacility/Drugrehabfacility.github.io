      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Decide to interact with others in the "living room" around the fireplace, or in front of one of many large, flat screen digital TVs packed with premium programming. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. 
      In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day.
