If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms.
