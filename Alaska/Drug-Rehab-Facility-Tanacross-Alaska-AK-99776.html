      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Our programs for drug withdrawal in Howell offers the best possible care to all of our patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life.
