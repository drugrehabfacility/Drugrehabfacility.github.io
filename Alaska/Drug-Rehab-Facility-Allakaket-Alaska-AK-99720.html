      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. 
      Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment.
