      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur.In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      Counseling is a good idea for your full therapeutic of the individual. As each person and detox program is different I will give you some important and unknown information first. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency.
