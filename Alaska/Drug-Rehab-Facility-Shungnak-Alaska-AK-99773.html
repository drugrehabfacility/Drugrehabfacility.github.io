      When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely.
