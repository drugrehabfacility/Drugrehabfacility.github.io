      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result.
