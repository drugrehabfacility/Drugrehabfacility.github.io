Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      There are many different types of detox centers, including Medical detox facilities Alcohol detox facilities Drug detox facilities Rapid detox facilities Holistic detox facilities Inpatient detox facilities Outpatient detox facilities Depending on your needs and your comfort level with certain types of treatment, one of these programs may be the best option for your needs.

      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.
