      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
