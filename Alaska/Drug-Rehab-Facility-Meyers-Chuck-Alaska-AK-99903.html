      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms During Detox - Drug Detox Centers Different drugs have different withdrawal symptoms during detox. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Choosing a professional detox also provides you with: Emotional support Treatment for any secondary medical and psychological issues Medication to ease cravings and physical discomfort Assistance from experts A solid foundation on which to build your recovery Massachusetts Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Between 2014 and 2015, Massachusetts experienced a 35.

      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy.

      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face.

      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.

      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment.Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs.
