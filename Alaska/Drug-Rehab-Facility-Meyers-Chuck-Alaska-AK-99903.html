      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Getting through detox isn’t just a matter of willpower. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.

      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD).
