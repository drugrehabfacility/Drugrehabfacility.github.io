      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary.

      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      I am grateful for this facility and hope anyone in need of detox chooses this place.
