      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.

      The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.
