    <p>
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body.

      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Please tell Kathy she is great, and made a big difference for me. 
      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.
