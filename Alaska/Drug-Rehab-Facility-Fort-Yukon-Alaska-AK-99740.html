(AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      When prescribed for cravings to opiates, methadone treatment is called methadone maintenance therapy. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs.

      You will get numerous diverse answers on how to avoid relapse such as; staying positive, going to meeting or groups and staying associated to your peers. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. 
      The 38-acre property provides an attractive setting for recovery and contemplation, including comfortable and comforting rooms, a full gymnasium, and beautiful natural surroundings. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      There are currently about three hundred drug treatment centers in Massachusetts.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Massachusetts.
