      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. 
      Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling.
