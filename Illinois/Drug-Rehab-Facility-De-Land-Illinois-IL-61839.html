      Most medical centers provide on allopathic approach using symptom treating methods of recovery: drug therapy. During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. Outpatient Drug Detox Outpatient programs provide high-level care for those needing a flexible schedule. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.

      The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient.

While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
