      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases. 
      This treatment program usually lasts for a Fairview UT 84629 period of 30-90 days. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs.
