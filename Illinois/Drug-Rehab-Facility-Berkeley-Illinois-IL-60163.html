      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      The supervisor (behavioral health tech) Kevin is caring and works hard to make sure all patients are safe and well taken care of. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Though alcohol addiction is prevalent in Maryland, only 11. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well.

      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures.Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol.
