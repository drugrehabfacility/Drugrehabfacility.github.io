      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.
