      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common.
