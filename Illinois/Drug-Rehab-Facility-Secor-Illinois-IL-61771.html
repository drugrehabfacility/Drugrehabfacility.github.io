      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
