      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it.
