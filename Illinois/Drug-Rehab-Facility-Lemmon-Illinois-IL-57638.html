      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. Call now to be connected with a compassionate treatment specialist.

      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body.

      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility.Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.
