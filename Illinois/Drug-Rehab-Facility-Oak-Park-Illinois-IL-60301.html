      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Beckett Springs, Beckett Ridge (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Beckett Springs is a 48-bed behavioral hospital that offers outpatient and inpatient mental health and addiction treatment for adults and their families. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. If a detox center doesn’t accept insurance, or if insurance only covers part of the services needed, what are the payment options? 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.

      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
