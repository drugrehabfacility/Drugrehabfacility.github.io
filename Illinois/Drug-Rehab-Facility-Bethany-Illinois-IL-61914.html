      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      The state’s government websites can also provide information on these services and how to apply for them. These centers can considerably exceed traditional recovery center effectiveness. "By the age of 20 I cured myself and helped several loved ones from chronic addictions, pharmaceutical drug dependency and life long mental health problems. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.

      They also provide detoxification, traditional care, extended care, intensive outpatient, aftercare and psychiatric services. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      When you are considering a facility for drug detox in Connecticut, consider a service that will not only be safe and effective but will also keep you comfortable. A good residential treatment facility will be able to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to the needs of each patient. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse.It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose.
