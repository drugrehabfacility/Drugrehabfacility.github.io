    <p>
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Let us help find a program that suits your needs. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. 
      Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises.

      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy.If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. 
      Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).
