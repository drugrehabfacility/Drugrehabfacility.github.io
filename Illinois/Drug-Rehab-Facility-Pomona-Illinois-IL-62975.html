      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment.

      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
