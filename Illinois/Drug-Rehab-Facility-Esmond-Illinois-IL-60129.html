      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Comfortable surroundings, pleasant and caring staff, provides the medical attention without the discomfort of a hospital environment. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process.

This allows someone to not so much focus on what is missing in their detox facility in Washington but more so on the next steps needed for them to get sober and stay sober after their physical detox. 
      With so much contrast and such a tourist-driven city at the state’s core, it comes as no surprise that people in the Nevada area do have their fair share (and sometime more than their fair share) of challenges and struggles.Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.
