      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Medical / natural integrative detox programs: Benzodiazepine Rehab, withdrawal from dangerous medications, alcohol or street drugs may need medicines to assist withdrawal. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. 
      We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Detox in NJ, especially for alcohol abusers, can take fluctuating amounts of time. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress.
