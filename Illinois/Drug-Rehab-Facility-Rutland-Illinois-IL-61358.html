      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps.

      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      We will then go over the best plan as to get you enrolled in that facility.They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
