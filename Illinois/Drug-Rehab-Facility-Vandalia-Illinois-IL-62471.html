      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal.
