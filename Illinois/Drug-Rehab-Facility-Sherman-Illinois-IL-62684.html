      Depending on the drug these symptoms will vary but may include: Heroin Withdrawal Symptoms – insomnia, muscle aches, bone pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating and chills. Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. If you’re seeking intervention resources, want to learn more about our programs or seek help for a loved one, contact us. 
      What an individual experiences at one treatment center may be vastly different from another person's experience elsewhere.

Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. 
      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
