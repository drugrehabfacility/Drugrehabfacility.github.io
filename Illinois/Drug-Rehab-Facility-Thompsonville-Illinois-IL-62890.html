      Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless.
