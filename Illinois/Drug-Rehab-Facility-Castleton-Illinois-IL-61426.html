      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.
