      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.

      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.
