      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Have there ever been strains on your or your loved one’s personal relationships as a result of drugs use? In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs.

      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.
