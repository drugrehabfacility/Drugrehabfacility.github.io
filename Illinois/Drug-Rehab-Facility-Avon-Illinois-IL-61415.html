      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Detox from drugs is a beneficial first step in the recovery process and can help promote positive change.
