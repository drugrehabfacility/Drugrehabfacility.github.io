      When choosing a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing.
