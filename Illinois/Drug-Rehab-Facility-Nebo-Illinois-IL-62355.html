The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs.

      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Amphetamine Withdrawal Symptoms – Often the least severe type of withdrawal users of amphetamines like methamphetamine, cocaine and prescriptions like Ritalin and Adderall experience symptoms like excessive sleeping and eating, depression, mood swings, paranoia and anxiety. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      TASC inspires and introduces confident behavior changes with a lasting revitalization for those in corrections, criminal justice, juvenile justice, child welfare and public systems and they do have the Per Se standard for drugged driving which prohibits driving while under the influence of alcohol and any other combination of drug(s).

It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
