      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      There are two nurses that are present during the whole procedure and they monitor the patient’s vitals and make sure that the procedure if flawless in its execution. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.
