      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment.
