      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse.
