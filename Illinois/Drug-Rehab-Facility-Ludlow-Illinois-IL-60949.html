      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room.

Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible.

      Testimonial by Ryan After attending many different programs I thought I would never get it, but my dad thought different. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better.
