      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. You don’t have to feel alone or helpless any longer, we are here to help you get your life back on track. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy.

      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. We would love to help you, but please make sure you more than anyone is ready for help. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs? 
      Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility.
