      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery. Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention.
