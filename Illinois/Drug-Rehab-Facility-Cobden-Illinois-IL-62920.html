      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. Alcohol detox and drug detoxification are the major treatments to be meted out to addicts. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      If you are unsure of choosing between inpatient detox and outpatient detox, contact us so we can determine together what the best alternative in your case is.
