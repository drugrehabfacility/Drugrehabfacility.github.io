      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there.
