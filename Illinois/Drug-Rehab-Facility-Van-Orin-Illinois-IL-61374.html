      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Drug Detox may be achieved without the use of medications, in some cases drugs may be prescribed or administered to ease the withdraw symptoms. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction.
