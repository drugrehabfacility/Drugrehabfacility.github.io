As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.

      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      The rehabilitation process has many phases and for someone to have a successful recovery, it is important for them to work hard and be committed during each section of this important and personal course of action.  Once a person decides they need help and wants to make an effort to get clean and sober, anyone in the area looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities can call Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center at (877) 855-3470 and talk to an addiction counselor to hear about all of the available programs.  Searching for rehab facilities and other care centers, including a Miami drug detox, can be a daunting process, but the highly trained professionals at Fort Myers White Sands will answer any questions you may have about your available options. IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision.
