      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services.

      Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required.

You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.
