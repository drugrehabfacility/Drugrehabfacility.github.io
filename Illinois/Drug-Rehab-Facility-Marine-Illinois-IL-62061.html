      Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.

      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Loans: Many treatment centers provide financing, and there are even specialty loan companies specifically for the purpose of funding treatment for individuals.

      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal.
