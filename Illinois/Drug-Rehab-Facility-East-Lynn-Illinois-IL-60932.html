      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause.

      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      Your doctor did not tell you how addictive benzos would be.
