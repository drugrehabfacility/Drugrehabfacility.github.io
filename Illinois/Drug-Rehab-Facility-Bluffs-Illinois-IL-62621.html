      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. 
      Even when it’s not as serious, it’s still a big challenge. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
