      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox.
