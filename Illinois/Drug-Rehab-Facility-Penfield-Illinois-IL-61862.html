      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
