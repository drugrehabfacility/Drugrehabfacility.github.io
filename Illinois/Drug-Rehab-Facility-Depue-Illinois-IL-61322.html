      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit.Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment.

      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.
