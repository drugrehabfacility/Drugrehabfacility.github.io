      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. 
      Just under 45,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of prescription pills in the last year.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction.
