      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it.

      Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back.
