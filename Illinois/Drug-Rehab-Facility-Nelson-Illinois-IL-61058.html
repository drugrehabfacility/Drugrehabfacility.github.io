      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
