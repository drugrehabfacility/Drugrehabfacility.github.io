      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.

      Changes to watch for include: Serious money problems Relationship conflicts over drug use Loss of motivation to meet work/school responsibilities Problems with the law, such as DUIs Inpatient vs. Effective Withdrawal and Integrated Medical Facilities Medications plus natural and therapeutic agents, such as proper hydration, mega nutrients, therapeutic touch and other therapies alleviate withdrawal effects much better than medications alone (if medications are indicated for a severe drug abuse situation).
