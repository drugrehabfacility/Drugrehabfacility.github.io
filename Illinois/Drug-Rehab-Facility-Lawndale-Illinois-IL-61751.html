      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription.
