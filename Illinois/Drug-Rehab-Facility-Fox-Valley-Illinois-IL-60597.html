      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically. A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. 
      Our goal is to help you break your chemical dependency as a safely and as comfortable as possible.
