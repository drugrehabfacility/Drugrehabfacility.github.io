      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. Or Contact Us by Email What can we help you find?
