      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Independent centers may use their own detox facilities when needed. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. Free programs can usually be found within the city-based regions of the state. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction.
