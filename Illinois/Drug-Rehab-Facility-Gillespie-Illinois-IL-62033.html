      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
