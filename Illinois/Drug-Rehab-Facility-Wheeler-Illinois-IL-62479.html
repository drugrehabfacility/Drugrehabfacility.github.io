      Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification. 
      I help people find smooth detox and rehab center programs so you can succeed in getting off drugs. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
