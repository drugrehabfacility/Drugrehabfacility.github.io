      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Amphetamine detox treatment works to ease uncomfortable withdrawal effects while providing much needed emotional support along the way. 
      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.
