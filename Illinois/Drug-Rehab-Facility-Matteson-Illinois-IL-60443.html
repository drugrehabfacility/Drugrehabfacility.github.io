      Rutherford, New Jersey Alcohol and Drug Detox: Your One-Stop Detox and Rehab Facility Most rehabilitation centers today require an addict to undergo a detoxification process elsewhere before enrollment into their rehab programs. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction.

      The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Here at United Drug Rehab Group, our wide network of specialists run a detox program that not only accommodates to the physical and emotional needs of our guest, but has also been proven to have a high recovery rate. 
      In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.
