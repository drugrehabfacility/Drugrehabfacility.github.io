      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now.
