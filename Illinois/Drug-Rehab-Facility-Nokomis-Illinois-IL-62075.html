      Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.
