      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help.
