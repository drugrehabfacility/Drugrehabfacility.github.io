      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 28% of all deadly car crashes involved Alcohol impairment. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program.

      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment.
