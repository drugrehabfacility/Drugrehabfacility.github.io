      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. 
      Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance.

      Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
