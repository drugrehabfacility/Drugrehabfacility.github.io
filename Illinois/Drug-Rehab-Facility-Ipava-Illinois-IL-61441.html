      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems.

      Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      You should ask whether the group has a telephone listing.Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs.
