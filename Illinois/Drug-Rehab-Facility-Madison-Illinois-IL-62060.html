      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities.

      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. 
      Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment.
