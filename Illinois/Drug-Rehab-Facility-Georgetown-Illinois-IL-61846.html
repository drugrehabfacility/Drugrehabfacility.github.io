      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. 
      Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.

      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. 
      All in-patient detox centers offer medically supervised care by either medical professionals closely monitoring a detox or by holistic detox specialists providing 24/7 attention under the guidance of detox doctors.If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Don’t think that you can’t get back to living a happy & healthy life If you have nowhere or nobody else to turn to, then now is the time to call us for help. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
