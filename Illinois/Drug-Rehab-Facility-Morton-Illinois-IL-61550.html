      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.
