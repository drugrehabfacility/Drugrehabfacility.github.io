      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.
