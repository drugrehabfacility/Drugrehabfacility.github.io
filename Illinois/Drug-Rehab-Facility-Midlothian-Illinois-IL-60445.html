      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. Gin isn’t any faster or slower for the body to process than whiskey. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. Stays may be as short as 7 days costing $15,000 and up. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
