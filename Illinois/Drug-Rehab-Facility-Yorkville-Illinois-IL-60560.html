      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.

      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Rehab Rehab facilities and programs have options that appeal to every lifestyle. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      Counseling results to intervention which involves seeking professional help by the concerned parties to give the patient the necessary treatment. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms.
