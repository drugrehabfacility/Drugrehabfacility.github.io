      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur.

The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs.
