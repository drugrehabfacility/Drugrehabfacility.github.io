      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to.
