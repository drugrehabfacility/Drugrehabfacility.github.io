      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Some of these individuals, even though they want to move past their addictions, give up on the idea of rehab altogether simply based on the inability to pay. To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. 
      But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.
