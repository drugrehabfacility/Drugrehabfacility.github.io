      A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. 
      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. 
      12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab.

      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible.

      This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
