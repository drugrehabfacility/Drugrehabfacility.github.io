      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. 
      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
