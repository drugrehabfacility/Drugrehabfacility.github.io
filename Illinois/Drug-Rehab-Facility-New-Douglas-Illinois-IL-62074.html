While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways.

      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      There are also other types of programs available that incorporate many modalities to achieving sober success for a lifetime.Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction.
