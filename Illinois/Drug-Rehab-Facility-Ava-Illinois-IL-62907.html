      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 
      Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment.
