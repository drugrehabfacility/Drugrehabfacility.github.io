      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it.

      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial.Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.

      In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.
