      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.

After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances.
