      The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      The detoxification programs offered by Chicago drug detox centers are wonderful means of restoring the substance abusers to a normal and healthy life. I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention.

      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).

      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
