      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Fill in the contact form below or give us a call. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      Pharmaceutical-based treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.

      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE).
