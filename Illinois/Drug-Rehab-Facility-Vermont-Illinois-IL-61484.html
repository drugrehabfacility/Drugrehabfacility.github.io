      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
