      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.

      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective.

      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. 
      And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. For more information on this facility go to www.zepfcenter.org/ 5. 
      The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.

      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Once this information is established, if the state deems that the client cannot pay, they may provide free treatment on various levels through specific types of clinics or treatment centers. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. Call 800-483-2193 today so you or your loved one can get the best care possible in your home state. 
      Getting the right detox withdrawal advice will save your life.
