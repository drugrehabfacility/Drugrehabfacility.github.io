      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse.
