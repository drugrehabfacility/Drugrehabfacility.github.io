      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Lauren was so sweet and just smiled and went along with Arianna, telling her “I brought you a broken cheeseburger?! A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.

      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.
