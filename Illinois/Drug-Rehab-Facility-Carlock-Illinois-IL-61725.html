      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated with Drug Detox Each drug affects the brain in a different way. 
      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.

      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
