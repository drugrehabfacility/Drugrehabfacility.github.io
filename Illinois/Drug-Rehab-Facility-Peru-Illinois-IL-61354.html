Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone.
