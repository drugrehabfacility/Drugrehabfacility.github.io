      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely.
