      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. 
      You don’t have to do it alone though, the drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer various forms of assistance to suit the different levels of addiction addicts may have experienced. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña.
