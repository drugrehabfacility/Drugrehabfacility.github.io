      Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction.

      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
