      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. 
      When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? Call our helpline at 800-483-2193 toll-free to speak with a specialist about your recovery needs. 
      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts.
