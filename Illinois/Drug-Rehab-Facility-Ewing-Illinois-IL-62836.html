      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.

      Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering.It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care.
