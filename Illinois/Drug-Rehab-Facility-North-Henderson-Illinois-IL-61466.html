      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking.
