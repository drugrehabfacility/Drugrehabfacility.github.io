      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. 
      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people.
