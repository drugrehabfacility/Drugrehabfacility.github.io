      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction.
