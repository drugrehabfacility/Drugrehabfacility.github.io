      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).

      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      Addiction did not occur in one day, or on its own.
