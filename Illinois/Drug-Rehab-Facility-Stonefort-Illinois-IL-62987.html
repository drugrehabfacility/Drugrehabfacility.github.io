      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. 
      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.

Recovery options after drug detox include inpatient rehab, outpatient addiction treatment and therapy.

      You may not feel ready to give up drugs and alcohol. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.
