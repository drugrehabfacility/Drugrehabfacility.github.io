      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. 
      This can help to ensure that all treatment methods and medications will be effective, without negative interactions. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab.

      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      24-Hour Care At our addiction treatment center, individuals receive 24-hour medical care that which includes psychiatric and nursing care as well as personalized wellness and medication plans. Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. The environment should be calm, quiet, and provide a space for individuals to recover in relative peace and comfort. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment.
