      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      There has been a considerable drug trafficking problem in the city of Hartford recently, and as a result, many of the citizens of this capital city of Connecticut have been left with serious drug addiction problems.

      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore.

      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox.
