      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.
