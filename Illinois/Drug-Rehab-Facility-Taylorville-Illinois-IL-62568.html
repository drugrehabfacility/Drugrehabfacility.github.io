      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. 
      People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms.
