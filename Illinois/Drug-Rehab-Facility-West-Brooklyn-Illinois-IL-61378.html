      Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs. After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptoms – This includes symptoms such as seizures, extreme depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, suicide, muscle aches, chest pain, dizziness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, paranoia, mood swings and many, many more. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. 
      Recovery options after drug detox include inpatient rehab, outpatient addiction treatment and therapy.
