      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. It does not have sympathy for any one race, gender, nation or background. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.
