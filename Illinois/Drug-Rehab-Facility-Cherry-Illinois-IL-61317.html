      Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.
