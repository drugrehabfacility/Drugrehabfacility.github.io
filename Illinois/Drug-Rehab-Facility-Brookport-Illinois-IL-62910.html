      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      Here, they found that 40 percent relapsed within a period of weeks, mostly due to the high-risk situations they encountered, such as: Interactions with other drug users Being provided with drugs Feeling low and sad Walking into places in which drugs were in use A drug detox program, particularly one that provides inpatient care, can amend these concerns. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification.
