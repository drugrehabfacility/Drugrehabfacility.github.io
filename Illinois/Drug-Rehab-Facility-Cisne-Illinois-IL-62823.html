      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.

      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.
