      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. There are priority populations in many state rehab centers.

      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority.
