      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. 
      The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      Following bad advice will cost you 2x or more than following correct detox withdrawal advice. Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture! 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
