      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. Our goal is to help you break your chemical dependency as a safely and as comfortable as possible. 
      We can help you find a program that's right for you or a loved one. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Free rehab centers and public assistance for rehab do exist.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      However, it also causes a person to go through withdrawal symptoms.
