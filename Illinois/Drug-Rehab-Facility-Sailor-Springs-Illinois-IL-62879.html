      Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. 
      When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine.
