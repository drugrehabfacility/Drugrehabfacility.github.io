      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Story of This Life uploaded a new video: Why moms get NOTHING DONE. 
      But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. It consists of an individualized tapering plan to address drug/alcohol dependence and regular check-ins with a medical doctor. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
