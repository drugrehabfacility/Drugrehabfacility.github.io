      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. The time you will spend at Sunrise Detox depends on type and amount of a drug being used so our intake specialists will help determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. 
      Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling.
