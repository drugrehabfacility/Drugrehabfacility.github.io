      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. 
      Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous.
