      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
