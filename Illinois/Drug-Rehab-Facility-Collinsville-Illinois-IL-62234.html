      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else.

      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      All care providers should be appropriately licensed and credentialed. Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored.
