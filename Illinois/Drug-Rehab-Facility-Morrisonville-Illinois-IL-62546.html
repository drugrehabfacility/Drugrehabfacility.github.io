      Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored.

      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible.
