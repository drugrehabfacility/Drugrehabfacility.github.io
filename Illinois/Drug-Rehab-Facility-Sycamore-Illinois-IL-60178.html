      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia.

      The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.Nevada is an anomaly when it comes to drug detox center admissions, though.
