      Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases.There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment.
