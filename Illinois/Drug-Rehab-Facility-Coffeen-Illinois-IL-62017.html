      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago.
