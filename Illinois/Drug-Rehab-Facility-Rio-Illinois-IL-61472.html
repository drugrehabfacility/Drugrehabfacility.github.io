      A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need. 
      Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.

      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.
