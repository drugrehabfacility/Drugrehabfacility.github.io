Let us help&#8230;</h3> <div class="textwidget">Addiction is a problem that affects more than just the drug abuser. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.Types of Detox Facilities Various methods exist to help someone detoxify from drugs. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesnâ€™t provide medical care unless thereâ€™s a life-threatening complication in play. If youâ€™ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.The number one primary substance of abuse among New Jersey residents who sought treatment in 2016 was heroin at 33,147 or 43 percent of treatment admissions. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Specific plans may have different coverage levels, so itâ€™s a good idea to check the specific policy or talk to the insurance provider. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.
