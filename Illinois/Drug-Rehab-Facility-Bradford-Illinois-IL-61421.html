      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well.
