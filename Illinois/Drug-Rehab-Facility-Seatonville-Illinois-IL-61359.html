      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications.
