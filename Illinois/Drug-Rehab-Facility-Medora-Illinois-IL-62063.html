      Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process. When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps?
