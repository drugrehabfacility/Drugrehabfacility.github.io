      No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.
