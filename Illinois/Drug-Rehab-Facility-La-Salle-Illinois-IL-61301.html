      I am happy to be here and I know anyone that comes here will be happy too.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.
