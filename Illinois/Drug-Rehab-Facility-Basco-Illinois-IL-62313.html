      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. 
      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.

      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help.

      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. A strong drugs dependency is one of the medication diseases and requirements specialists. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well.

      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs.
