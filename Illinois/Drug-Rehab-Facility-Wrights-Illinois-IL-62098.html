      Help to end the disease and ravages of drug abuse is a phone call away.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly.
