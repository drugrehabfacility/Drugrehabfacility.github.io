      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs? What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Your will worry you and possibly fill you with shame.
