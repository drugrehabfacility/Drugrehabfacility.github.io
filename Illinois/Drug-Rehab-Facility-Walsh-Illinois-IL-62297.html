      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine.
