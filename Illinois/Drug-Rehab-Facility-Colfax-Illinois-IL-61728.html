      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. Uinderstand that methadone is a highly addictive substitute where the withdraw can be up to three times worse than heroin. 
      Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means.

Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.
