Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.
