      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober?
