      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.

      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol.
