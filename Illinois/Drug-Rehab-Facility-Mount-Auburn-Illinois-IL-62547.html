      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.
