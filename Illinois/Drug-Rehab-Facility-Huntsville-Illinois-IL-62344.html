      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated.
