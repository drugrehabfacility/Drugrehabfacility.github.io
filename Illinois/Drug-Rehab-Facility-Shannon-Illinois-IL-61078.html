      When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
