      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs?
