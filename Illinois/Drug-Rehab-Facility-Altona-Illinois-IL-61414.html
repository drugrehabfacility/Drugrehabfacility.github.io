      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built.

      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself. 
      They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission.
