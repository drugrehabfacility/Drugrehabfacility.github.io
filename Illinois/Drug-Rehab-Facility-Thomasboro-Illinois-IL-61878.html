      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.

      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process.

      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.

      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant.In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior.
