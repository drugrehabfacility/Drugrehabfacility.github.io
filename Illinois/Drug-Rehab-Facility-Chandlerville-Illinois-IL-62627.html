      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Their expert staff help with complete medical and psychiatric assessments, individualized care, and spiritual renewal for the whole family.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
