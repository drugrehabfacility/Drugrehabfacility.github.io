      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming. 
      One important note with drug free detox is that it must not be done for an individual for whom it is medically necessary to use medications to come off of drugs. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      Our in-house program allows the medical team to begin working to improve your life in a drug-free environment. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.
