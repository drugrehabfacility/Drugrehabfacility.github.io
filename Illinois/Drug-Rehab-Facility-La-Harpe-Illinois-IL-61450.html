      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face.
