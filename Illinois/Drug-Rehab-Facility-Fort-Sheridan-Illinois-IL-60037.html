      During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens.
