      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. 
      You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve. Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Above the Standard: I believe in only working with people and centers that I personally trust. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. 
      3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs.

      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. The information is free, the call is free and so is the referral. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible.

      The length of stay for detox can vary, the above is a general guide, so please contact Sunrise Detox directly to learn more about what specific needs will be.   If you have any questions please contact our admissions specialists by calling 888-443-3869.Detox implies to assist in getting rid of the contaminants (poisons) from a body. A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. 
      These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question.
