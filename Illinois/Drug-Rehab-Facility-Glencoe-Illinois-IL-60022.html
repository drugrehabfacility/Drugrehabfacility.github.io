      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. Once this information is established, if the state deems that the client cannot pay, they may provide free treatment on various levels through specific types of clinics or treatment centers. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Quick drug detoxification allows us to clean the receptors completely. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. 
      According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life.
