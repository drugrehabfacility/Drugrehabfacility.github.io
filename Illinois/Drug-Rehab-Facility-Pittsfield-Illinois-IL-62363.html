      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.
