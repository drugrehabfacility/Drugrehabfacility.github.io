      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol.
