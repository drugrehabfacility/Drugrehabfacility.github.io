The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Drug Rehab Advisor insures when you attend a detox or rehab program you will get the detox withdrawal advice and services you expected.

      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction.Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again.
