      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area.

      Vincent Depaul provide free treatment for those who qualify for help. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. These pharmaceutical drugs are designed to blunt the effects of the physical withdrawal symptoms that can make regular detox so difficult. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.
