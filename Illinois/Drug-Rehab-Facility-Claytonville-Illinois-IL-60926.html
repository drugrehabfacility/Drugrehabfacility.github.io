      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. 
      Serene Setting Panoramic windows, abundant natural light, and a soothing color palette promote well-being. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. 
      This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction.
