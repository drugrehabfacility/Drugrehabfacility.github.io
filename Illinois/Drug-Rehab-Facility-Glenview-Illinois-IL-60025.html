      Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.
