      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.
