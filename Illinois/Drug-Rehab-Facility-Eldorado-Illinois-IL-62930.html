      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      For example, before coming into a certain Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois, the addict should detox from alcohol.
