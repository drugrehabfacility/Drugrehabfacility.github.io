      An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.
