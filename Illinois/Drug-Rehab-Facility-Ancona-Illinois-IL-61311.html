      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Through counseling, addicts are able to know the behaviors and problems which come with their state of mind. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.
