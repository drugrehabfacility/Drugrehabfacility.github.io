      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78. The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. 
      Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isnâ€™t a big deal. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Further, in the report, it was also mentioned with the increase in the number of Massachusetts detox centers, number of people admitted to these facilities also increased to around 36,815. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
