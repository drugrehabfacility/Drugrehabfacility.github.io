      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. All of our Massachusetts rehab facilities give you the results you need to live a beautiful life, free from your addiction!Detoxification is an important first step on the road of recovery for an individual addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.TASC inspires and introduces confident behavior changes with a lasting revitalization for those in corrections, criminal justice, juvenile justice, child welfare and public systems and they do have the Per Se standard for drugged driving which prohibits driving while under the influence of alcohol and any other combination of drug(s). 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction.Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

    <p>
      Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
