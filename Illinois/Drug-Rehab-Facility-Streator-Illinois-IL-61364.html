      Our counselors are here to help guide you to the right Detox Center for your Addiction. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs.
