      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
