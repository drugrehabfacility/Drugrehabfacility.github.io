      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). And this will help lessen the pain by giving them anesthesia. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      Withdrawal Symptoms During Detox - Drug Detox Centers Different drugs have different withdrawal symptoms during detox. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you.
