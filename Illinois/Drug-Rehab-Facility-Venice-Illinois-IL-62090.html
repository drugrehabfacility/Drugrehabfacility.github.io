      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      Just a little effort can bring opportunities to detox and enter recovery with little or no cost to the individual.
