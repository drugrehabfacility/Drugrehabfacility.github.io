      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there?

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users.

      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need.

      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment.
