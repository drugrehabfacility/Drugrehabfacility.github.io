      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      Types of Treatment Available Drug rehabilitation is addressed through various Fairview UT 84629 programs which include; use of local support groups, addiction counseling, medical care, residential treatment, extended care givers, mental health, recovery houses and orthomolecular medicine.
