      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. You fixded my cheeseburger!” When Lauren walked away, Arianna just sat there for a second and looked at her new burger. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. 
      They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. 
      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers.
