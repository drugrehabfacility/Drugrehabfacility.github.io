      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life. 
      Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.
