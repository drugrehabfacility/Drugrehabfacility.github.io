      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      There are various treatment methods used by these drug detox centers such as Suboxone treatment, EMDR, outpatient treatment, cognitive behavioral treatment, psychodrama, trauma treatment, etc. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more.

      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs.

      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. I called Treatment Center Finder and one of their addiction specialists found me the rehab that saved my life! -Kelly S. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible.
