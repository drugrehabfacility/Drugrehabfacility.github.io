      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become.
