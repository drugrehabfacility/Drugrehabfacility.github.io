      Medications that Help Addiction treatment has come a long way, and inpatient drug detox centers have a variety of different medications that they can use to help people deal with withdrawal.

Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s).
