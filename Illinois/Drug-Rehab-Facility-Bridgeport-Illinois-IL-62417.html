      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted.
