      Most medical centers provide on allopathic approach using symptom treating methods of recovery: drug therapy. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 888-424-2626 A professional and courteous consultant will contact you. 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance.

      In the third phase of treatment is implamantation of the implant. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. 
      In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered.Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Alcoholics do not understand that they're going to become an individual, and don't the folks. 
      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice.The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach. 
      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results.

      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.
