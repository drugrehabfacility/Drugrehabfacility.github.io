      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Finding help with treatment can make the burden feel less troublesome, and it can help those struggling with addiction to get their lives back. 
      Once the addict feels that daily care as well as daily counseling is not longer needed they can transition to an out-patient drug treatment center. Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs.
