      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease.
