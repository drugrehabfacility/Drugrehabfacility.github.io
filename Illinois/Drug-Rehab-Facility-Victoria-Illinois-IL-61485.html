      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
