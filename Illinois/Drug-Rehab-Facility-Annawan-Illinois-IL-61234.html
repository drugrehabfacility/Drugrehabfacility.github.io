      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly.

      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine.
