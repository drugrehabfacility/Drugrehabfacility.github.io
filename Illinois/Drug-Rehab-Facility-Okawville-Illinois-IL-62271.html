      While traveling for treatment is a personal choice, we can help you figure out if it the best option for you. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
