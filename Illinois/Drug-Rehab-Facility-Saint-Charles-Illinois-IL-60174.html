    <p>
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. They have more than four decades of experience, which they have used to perfect the most effective, evidence-based therapies and clinical approaches to rehabilitation. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility.
