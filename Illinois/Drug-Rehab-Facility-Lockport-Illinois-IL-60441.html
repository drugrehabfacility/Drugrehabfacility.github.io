      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process.

Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
