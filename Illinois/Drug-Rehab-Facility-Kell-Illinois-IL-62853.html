      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease.

      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. Counseling Individual and group counseling is used to identify the underlying issues that led to a client’s addiction. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic.Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body.

      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated With Detox There are a number of intense withdrawal symptoms that individuals report experiencing when they go through the  detox process. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
