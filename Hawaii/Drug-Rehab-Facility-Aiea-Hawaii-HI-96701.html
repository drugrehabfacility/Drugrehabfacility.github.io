      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you.
