      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs? At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings.
