      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. The New Jersey drug detox centers have to deal with patients suffering from withdrawal symptoms, which is the most difficult part of the treatment process.
