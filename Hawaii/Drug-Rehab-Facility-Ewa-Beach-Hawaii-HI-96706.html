      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      The goal is to help you get mentally and physically stable. This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose.
