      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. The rehabilitation process has many phases and for someone to have a successful recovery, it is important for them to work hard and be committed during each section of this important and personal course of action.  Once a person decides they need help and wants to make an effort to get clean and sober, anyone in the area looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities can call Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center at (877) 855-3470 and talk to an addiction counselor to hear about all of the available programs.  Searching for rehab facilities and other care centers, including a Miami drug detox, can be a daunting process, but the highly trained professionals at Fort Myers White Sands will answer any questions you may have about your available options. 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits.
