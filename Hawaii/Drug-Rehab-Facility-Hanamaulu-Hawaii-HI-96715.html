      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. 
      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive.
