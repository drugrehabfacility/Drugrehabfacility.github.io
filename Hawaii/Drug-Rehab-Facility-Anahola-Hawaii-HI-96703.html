      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Stats & Facts Over a three-year span, Illinois has experienced at least 900 deaths due to Heroin overdose. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance.
