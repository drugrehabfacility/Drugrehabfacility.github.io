      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. 
      A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so.

      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery.
