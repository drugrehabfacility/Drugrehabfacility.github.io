      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
