      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted.
