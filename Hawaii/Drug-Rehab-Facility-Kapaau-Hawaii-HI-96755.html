      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. 
      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong.

      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. 
      In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected.Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.

      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.
