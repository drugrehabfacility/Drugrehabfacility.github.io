      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      The most common of these drug detox programs is Christian drug detox. The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. 
      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment.
