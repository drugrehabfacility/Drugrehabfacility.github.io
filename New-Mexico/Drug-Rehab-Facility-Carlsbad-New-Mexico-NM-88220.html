      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      Whether you are looking for a drug detox in Boston or any other area, we can help. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward.

      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Completing a detox treatment program doesn’t mean that a person suddenly feels 100% perfect, but they do feel physically better, and are now ready to begin rehab. 
      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own.
