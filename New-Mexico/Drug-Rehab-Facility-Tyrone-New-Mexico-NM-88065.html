      People think that because alcohol is legal and easily accessed that it cannot be as bad. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel.

      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines. The goal is to help you get mentally and physically stable.
