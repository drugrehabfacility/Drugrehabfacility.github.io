      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). It is never too late to seek out help of a treatment facility, addiction is a powerful foe, it will only continue to get worse unless you do something about it. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña.
