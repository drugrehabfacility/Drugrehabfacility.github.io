      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so.
