      Motivational incentives: it makes use of positive things meant to encourage the patient to abstain from addictive substances. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. That’s not to say living sober is boring, mind you. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. Although integrative medicine is easily the most popular and effective treatment strategy for any health problem, currently there are only a few integrative medical detox centers in North America. 
      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab.
