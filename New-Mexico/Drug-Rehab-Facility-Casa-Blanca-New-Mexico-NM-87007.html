      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.
