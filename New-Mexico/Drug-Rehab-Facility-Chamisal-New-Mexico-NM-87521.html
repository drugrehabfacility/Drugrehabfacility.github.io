      Free rehab centers and public assistance for rehab do exist. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. We know you are a good person needing help, and we have helped hundreds before you. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.

      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      Heroin use in Ohio is also higher than national averages. Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
