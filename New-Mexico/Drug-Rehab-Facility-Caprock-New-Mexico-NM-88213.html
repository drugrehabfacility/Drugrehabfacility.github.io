When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab.
