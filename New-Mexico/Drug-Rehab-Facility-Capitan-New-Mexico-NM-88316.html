      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. With practicing kindness, while continuing to work on yourself as a person, you may find relapse prevention is an inspiring and gratifying. 
      If you need a snack, you can visit the cafe-style dining area. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs.

      Free detox treatment options can be used when all other means for paying for treatment have been exhausted. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.

      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      It eases their transition and also helps them consider what they need to do to get better. Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation.

      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated.

      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. In the each situation I have learned "from you" to look at the positive, in everything however small it may seem. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Give one of our counselors a call now.  1-800-819-9973 Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Locator Service is a public benefit service for those seeking to enter into a treatment program for addiction.
