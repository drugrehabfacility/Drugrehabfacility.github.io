      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. Although detox facilities in Washington go above and beyond, detox is not the first and final step of any person’s recovery. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.

      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available.
