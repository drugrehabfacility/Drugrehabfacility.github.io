      Jude's Guidance CT Drug Detox Options Making the decision to seek drug detoxification for your drug use is a step toward rebuilding your life without drugs. 
      The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      Treatment Center Finder will connect you with the right Massachusetts rehab for you or your loved one. The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method.
