      While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. 
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available.
