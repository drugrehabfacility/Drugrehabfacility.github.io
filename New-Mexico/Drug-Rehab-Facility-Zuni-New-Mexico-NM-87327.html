      There are many Illinois Detox Centers Services able to help people suffering from substance abuse. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free.

      Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Either way we are here to help you and answer any and all of your questions.
