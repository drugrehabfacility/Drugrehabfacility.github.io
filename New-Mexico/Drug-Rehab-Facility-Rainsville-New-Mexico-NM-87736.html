      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. A natural approach instead of medications is used to rapidly repair health and restore proper body function. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
