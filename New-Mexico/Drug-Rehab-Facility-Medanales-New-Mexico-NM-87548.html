      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. 
      Drug rehabilitation involves the following types of behavioral therapy; Cognitive behavioral therapy: helps patients know, avoid and bear with situations which may make them return to their addiction habits. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with.
