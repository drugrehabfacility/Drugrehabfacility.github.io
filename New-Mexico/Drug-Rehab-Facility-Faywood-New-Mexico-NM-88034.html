      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      The particular Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois presents therapeutic addiction programs for those people who are suffering from heroin dependency. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly.

      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective.
