The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox.

      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      Detoxification is accompanied by psychological cleansing as well. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      These groups are most often free, requiring no dues.
