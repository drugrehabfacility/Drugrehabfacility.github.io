This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. Therapy Behavioral therapies are often used as a part of the detox treatment for those in inpatient detox.
