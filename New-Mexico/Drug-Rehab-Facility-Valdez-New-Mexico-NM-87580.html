      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. The detoxification process is often physically and mentally draining. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Until a person is mentally and physically stabilized, they are not prepared to participate in the treatement methods and counseling utilized by drug treatment centers.

      Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.
