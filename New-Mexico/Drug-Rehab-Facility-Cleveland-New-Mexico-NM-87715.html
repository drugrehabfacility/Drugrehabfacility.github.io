      A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. This is where the process of drug detox comes in.
