      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. 
      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
