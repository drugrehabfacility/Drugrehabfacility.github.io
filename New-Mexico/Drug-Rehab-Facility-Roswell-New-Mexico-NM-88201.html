      Rapid Detox Versus Traditional Detox Free Detox Centers Some people just can’t afford any type of treatment for their addiction. These individuals may not know that there are options for them. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. These types of drug detoxs in New Jersey are common. 
      Natural Treatment for Drug Addiction Natural detox is still a popular form of overcoming one’s physical addiction to drugs. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
