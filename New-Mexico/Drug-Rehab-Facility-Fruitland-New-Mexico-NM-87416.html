      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. 
      Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community. Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
