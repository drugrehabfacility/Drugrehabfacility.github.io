      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. 
      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them.
