      New Destiny Treatment, Clinton (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today New Destiny Treatment Center is an affiliate of the Barberton Rescue Mission which began in 1961 as a home for alcoholics and homeless people. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.
