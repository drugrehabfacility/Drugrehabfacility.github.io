      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
