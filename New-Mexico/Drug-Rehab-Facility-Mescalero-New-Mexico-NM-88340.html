      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.

      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      1300857 Oakridge Counseling Center battle-creek,MI 4 years, 11 months Ago Dear Mr. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.
    </p>
    <p>
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
