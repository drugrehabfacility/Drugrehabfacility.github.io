    <p>
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Opiates are available in many shapes and sizes and include heroin, Oxycodone, Roxicontin, opium and a list of other prescription medications known as opioids. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      Typically, the length of stay for these treatment centers for addiction is shorter because of the concentration being on getting rid of medical problems as well as providing alcohol or drug detoxification services. Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone.

      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      Rutherford Drug Detox Centers offer a drug addiction treatment process that starts with detoxification. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly.
