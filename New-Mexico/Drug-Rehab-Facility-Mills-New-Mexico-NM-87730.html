      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. Our medical teams use the latest evidence-based approaches to make sure this period is safe and as comfortable as possible. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer.

      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. 
      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all.
