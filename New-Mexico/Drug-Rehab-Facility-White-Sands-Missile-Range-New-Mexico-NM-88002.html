      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
