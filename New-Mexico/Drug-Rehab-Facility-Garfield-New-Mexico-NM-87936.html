    <p>
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Everyone, from the hostess to the chef, played a role in what most people would think isn’t a big deal. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      Not only will they see in their peers the various stages of success. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington.
