      Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.

      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      When Lauren came back to check on us, I asked if we could order another cheeseburger and just add it to our check. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.
