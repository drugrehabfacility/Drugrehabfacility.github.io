      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Some of these symptoms can be medically dangerous and lead to damaging side effects.
