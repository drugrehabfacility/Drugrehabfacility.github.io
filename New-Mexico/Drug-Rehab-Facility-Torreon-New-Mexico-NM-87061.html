      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.
