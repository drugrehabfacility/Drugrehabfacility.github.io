      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem.

      Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.
