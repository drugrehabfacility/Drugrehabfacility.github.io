      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life.Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      If you are skeptical of their success, you need only to head over to their Facebook page, where thousands of former clients and members of the community come together. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
