      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.
