      The normal means of this kind of heroin detox is simply by permitting anyone to stop using heroin drug. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.

      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
