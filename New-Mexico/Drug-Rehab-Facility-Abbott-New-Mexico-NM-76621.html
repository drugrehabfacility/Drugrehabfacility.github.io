      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse.

      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer.
