      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.
