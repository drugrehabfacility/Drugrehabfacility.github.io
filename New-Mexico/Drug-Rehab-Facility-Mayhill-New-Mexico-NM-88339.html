      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      Round-the-Clock Care – You’ll be monitored around the clock by staff that will check vital signs and make sure that you feel comfortable and cared for.
