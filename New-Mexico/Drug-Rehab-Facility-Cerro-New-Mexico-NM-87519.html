      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question.
