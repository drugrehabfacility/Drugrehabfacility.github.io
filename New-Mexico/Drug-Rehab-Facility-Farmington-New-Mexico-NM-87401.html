      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
