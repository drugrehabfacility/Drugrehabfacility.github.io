      The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well.

      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. The care you’ll need depends in part on where you fall in that range. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
