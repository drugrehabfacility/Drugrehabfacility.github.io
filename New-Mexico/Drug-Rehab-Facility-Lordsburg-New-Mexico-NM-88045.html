      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.
