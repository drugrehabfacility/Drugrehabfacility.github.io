Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question.I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager.
