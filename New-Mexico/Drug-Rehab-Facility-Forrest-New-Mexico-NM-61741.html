      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. In the case of a physically addictive substance like opiates or alcohol, the detox process may involve the use of pharmaceutical drugs. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction.

      While many detox programs will tell you that you have a brain disease and that there is no hope; the truth is you are not diseased and there are solutions available to you. The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.
