      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. You may have: Anxiety Delirium tremens (DTs), a life-threatening issue where you feel confused and on edge Depression Hallucinations, where you see or hear things that aren’t there Problems sleeping Shakiness, especially in your hands Unstable changes in blood pressure and heart rate Do I Need a Detox Program? 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort.
