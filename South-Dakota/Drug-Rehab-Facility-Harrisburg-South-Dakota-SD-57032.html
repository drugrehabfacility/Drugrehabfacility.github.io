      Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. 
      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found?
