      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      To make it as comfortable as possible for you, we provide you with all necessities as well as an arrange of amenities to make your stay both healing and enjoyable. Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else.
