      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale.
