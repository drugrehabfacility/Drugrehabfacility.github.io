      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment.
