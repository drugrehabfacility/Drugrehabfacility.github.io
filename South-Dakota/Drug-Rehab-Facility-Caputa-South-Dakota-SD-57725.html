      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Alcohol abuse also has a major impact on state residents — 91 percent of whom are not receiving addiction treatment as needed. Can I get a private room during my stay in detox? 
      We make the most effective, affordable, top-rated drug detox facilities available to help you beat addiction. It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.
