      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. 
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
