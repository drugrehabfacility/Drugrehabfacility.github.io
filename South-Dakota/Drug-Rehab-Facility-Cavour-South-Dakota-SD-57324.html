      If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time.

      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior.
