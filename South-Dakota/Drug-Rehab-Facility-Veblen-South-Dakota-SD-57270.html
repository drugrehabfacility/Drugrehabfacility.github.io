      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. 
      We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.
