      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction.The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      Specific plans may have different coverage levels, so it’s a good idea to check the specific policy or talk to the insurance provider. Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
