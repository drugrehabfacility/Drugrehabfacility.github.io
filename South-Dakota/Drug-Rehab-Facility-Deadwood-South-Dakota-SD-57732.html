      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. 
      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.

      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      I am grateful for this facility and hope anyone in need of detox chooses this place. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option.Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend.
