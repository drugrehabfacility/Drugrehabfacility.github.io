      Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. 
      Hydrocodone continues to be the most available prescription to nonprescribed users for Opioid abuse. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists. 
      Let Sober Living Drug Rehab guide and assist you on the right route to a high quality treatment program for drug addiction.
