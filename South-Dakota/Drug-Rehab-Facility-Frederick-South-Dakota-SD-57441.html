      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. 
      There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. 
      Our specialists will connect you with a detox facility where you'll receive high-quality detox care tailored to your individual needs. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through.
