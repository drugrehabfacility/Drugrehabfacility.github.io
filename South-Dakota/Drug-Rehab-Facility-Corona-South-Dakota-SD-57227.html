      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance.
