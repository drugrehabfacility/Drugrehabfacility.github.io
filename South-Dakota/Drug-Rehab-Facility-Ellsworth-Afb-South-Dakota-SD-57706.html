      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them. 
      Alcoholics do not understand that they're going to become an individual, and don't the folks. Methadone detox centers provide professional medical care to assist those addicted to methadone with their first phase of recovery—detoxification. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens.
