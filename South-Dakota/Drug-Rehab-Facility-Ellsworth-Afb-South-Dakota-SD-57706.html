      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems.

      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them.

      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      In 2009, according to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) survey for those who entered into a detox center, they had 11, 275 admissions of which 4, 481 completed their detox, 3, 496 were reassigned to other facilities, 2, 288 left detox, 401 were let go, and 15 under other unknown reasons. So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. 
      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions.
