      However, many individuals are able to go through withdrawal quickly and continue on to rehab treatment shortly after. Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening.That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.

Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.
