      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important.

      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Do you want to get more exposure to people looking for your services in your city? 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Once recovery is in progress, it can help to be surrounded by others who understand and who can help the recovering individual through the process, such as by participating in self-help groups and other counseling programs. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.
