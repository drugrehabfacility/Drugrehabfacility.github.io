      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse.

      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal.

It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.
