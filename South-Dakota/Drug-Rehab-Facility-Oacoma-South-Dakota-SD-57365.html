      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse.

      The benefits of drug detox rehab are as endless and open as the number of people who require such treatment in order to find lasting sobriety. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
