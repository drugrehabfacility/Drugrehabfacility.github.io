      Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
