      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox.

      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature.
