      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      Holistic program options are also available in Ohio. There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics. 
      Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.
