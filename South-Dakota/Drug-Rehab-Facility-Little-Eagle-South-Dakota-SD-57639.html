      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process. 
      If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment? During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer.
