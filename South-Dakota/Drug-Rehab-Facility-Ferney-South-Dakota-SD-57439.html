      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. The typical course of detox for drug or alcohol abuse often begins with a thorough examination of the patient. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      The manager, Bradley Cottermole, then came to our table, kneeled down, and said to Arianna, “I heard we gave you a broken cheeseburger! Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects.

      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.
