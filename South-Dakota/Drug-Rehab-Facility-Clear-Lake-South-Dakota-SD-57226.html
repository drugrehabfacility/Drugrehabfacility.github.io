      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. Contact us by filling out the form or by simply grabbing the phone and calling. 
      Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.
