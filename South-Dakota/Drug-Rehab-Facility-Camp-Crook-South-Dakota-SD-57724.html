      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal. The manager, Bradley Cottermole, then came to our table, kneeled down, and said to Arianna, “I heard we gave you a broken cheeseburger!
