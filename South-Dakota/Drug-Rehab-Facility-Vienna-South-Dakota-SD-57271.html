      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. 
      Make the call and get him or her the help needed today. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. 
      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery.
