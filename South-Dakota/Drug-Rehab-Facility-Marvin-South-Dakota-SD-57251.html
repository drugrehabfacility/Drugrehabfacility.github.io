      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. 
      These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
