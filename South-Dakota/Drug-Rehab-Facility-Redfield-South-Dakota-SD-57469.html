      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day.

      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem.
