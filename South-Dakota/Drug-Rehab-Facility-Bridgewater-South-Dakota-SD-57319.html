      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. The reasons range from simple experimentation to full blown trauma; the causes of starting of are endless. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.
