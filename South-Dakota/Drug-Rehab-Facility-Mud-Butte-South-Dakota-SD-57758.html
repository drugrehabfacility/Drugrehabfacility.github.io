      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial.

      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. 
      They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups.
