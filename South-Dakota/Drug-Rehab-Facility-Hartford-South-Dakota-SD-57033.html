      Detox centers in Connecticut provide: Around-the-clock care that ensures your safety if life-threatening symptoms of withdrawal arise. 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. There are plenty of places where drugs will tempt the recovering addict, it is important that several avenues are offered for recovery. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. The information is free, the call is free and so is the referral. 
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Counseling is also provided by the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts.
