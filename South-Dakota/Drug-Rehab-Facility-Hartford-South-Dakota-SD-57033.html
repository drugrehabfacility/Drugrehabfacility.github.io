      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.
