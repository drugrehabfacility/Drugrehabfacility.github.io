      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      There are people who have been where you are and are now living a life of recovery. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease.
