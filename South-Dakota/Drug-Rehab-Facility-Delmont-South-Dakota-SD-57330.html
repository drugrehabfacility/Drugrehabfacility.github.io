      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many.

      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. 
      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal.
