      Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. 
      Alcohol detox is often done with anticonvulsant medications such as benzodiazepine drugs to prevent the risk for seizure.  Most alcohol detox is done without the use of drugs, however, if there is potential for seizure risk medications and required.  Replacement Drug Detox is done through a “wind down” process.In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. Community-based programs sponsored by organizations like the Salvation Army and St. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation.

      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves. Medications may be used to prevent seizures, and patients commonly receive intravenous fluids, often with extra vitamins and minerals.
