      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      While checked into inpatient treatment you will have all the luxuries of being at home with an easy to follow program towards recovery. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      It is possible for you to get back to feeling like your life is worth something. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month.
