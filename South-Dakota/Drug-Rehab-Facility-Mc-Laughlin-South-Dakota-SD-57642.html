      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users.
