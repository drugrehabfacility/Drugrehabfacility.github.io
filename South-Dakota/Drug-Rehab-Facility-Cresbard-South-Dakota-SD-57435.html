      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need.

      You may not feel ready to give up drugs and alcohol. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      Medical monitoring and physical care are provided as well as meals, social support and other services to ensure the safety and sobriety of the individual. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.
