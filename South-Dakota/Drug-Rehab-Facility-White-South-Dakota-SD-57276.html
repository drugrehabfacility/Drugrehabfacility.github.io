      Even within such a beautiful place, the residences still are faced with the same issues of addiction and substance abuse that afflict the rest of the world. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs.
