      Outpatient Detox Treatment Program Outpatient detox can last from a few days to a week or more. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      As discussed in part above, many of these rehab center options require that clients apply and are accepted to the programs based on certain qualifications. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.

      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good.

      Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.
