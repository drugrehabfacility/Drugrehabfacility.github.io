      Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used. 
      The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. You're certain that a meeting isn't on Earth which may help you.

      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
