      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group.
