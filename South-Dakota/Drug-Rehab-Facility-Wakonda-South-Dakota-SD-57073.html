      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. 
      Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week!
