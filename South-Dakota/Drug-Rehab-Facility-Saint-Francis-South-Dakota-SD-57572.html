      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.
