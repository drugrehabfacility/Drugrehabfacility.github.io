      Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. 
      The most common reason that people seek out treatment from a drug detox center in the state of Nevada is for stimulant abuse and addiction, namely meth (methamphetamine). With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      Withdrawal symptoms from methadone are painful and can last several weeks. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      The right #detox or #rehab program can put you back on track and on the road to #recovery and a #soberlife.
