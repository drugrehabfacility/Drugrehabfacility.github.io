      Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. 
      As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
