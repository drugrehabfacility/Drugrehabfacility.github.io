      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. Depending on which drug detox center you choose, we may use the following approaches, among others, to ensure a safe and comfortable detox: Comprehensive Assessments – Your treatment team will conduct physical exams and assessments to determine the most effective detox protocols based on your drug(s) of abuse, medical history and individual needs. 
      In fact, there are a variety of different options out there for people who need to move past drugs. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior.
