      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
