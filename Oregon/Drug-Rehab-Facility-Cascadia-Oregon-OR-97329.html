      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      At these meetings, you'll find the loving support of women and men that are currently fighting with similar difficulties and discover how they've learned to look after themselves. If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary.

      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.

      In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day. 
      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs.Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.

      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Our medical teams use the latest evidence-based approaches to make sure this period is safe and as comfortable as possible.Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system.They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. 
      The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible.
