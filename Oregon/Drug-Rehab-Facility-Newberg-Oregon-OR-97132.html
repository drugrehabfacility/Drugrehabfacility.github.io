Подробнее drugdetoxcenters.com Drug Detox Centers · 11 апреля · Many #NewHampshire residents are struggling with drug or #alcohol addiction, and don't know where to go to start on the road to #recovery. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. 6 percent of those individuals aged 12 or older who suffered from alcohol dependence or abuse in New Jersey received treatment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). 
      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.
