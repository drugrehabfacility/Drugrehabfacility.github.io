      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high. 
      While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip. Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
