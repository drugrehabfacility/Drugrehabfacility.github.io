      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using.
