      Find an Amphetamine Addiction Treatment Center If you’ve reached the point where you’re considering drug addiction treatment in Massachusetts, it’s likely drug use has already caused some real problems in your day-to-day life. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable.

      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.
