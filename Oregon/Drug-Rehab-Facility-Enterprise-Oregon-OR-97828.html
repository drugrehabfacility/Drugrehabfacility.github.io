      The most common reason that people seek out treatment from a drug detox center in the state of Nevada is for stimulant abuse and addiction, namely meth (methamphetamine).

      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. It is estimated that 95 percent of people needed but didn’t receive treatment for Alcohol abuse. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      By the time detox becomes necessary, the body has temporarily forgotten how to produce positive sensations.

In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction.
