      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
