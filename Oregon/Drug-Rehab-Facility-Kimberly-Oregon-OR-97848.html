      Physical dependence is one of the most difficult parts of any addiction to overcome but with the help of detox centers and the specialized programs, medications, therapists and medical interventionist who provide care at these facilities, those who suffer from even the strongest of addictions can get past the physical dependence that keeps them using drugs or alcohol and prepare for psychological recovery. 
      28% of all deadly car crashes involved Alcohol impairment. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture!
