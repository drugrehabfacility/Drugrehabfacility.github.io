      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment.

      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      From there, symptoms can last anywhere from two days to two weeks.
