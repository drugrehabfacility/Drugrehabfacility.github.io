For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks.

      Testimonial by Karla "When I called you, I was told that my recovery was in my hands; I had the power to make the choices that would dictate my future. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again.
