      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening.

      What kinds of Hartford drug detox programs are available? For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Specialized progressive diets emphasize the balanced nutrition necessary for healing. 
      Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox.

      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      We can help you determine what option is best for you.
