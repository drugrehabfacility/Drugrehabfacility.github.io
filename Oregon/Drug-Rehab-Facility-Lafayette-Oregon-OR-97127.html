      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process.

      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells.How much has it or will it cost you financially or in loss if a good solution is not found? 
      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients.

      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs.
