      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      6 percent of the people who needed that treatment. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun. 
      Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient.
