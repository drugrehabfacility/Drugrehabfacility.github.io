      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful.4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective.
