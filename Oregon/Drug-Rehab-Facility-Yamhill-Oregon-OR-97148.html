      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
