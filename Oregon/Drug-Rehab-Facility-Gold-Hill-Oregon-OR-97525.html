      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects.
