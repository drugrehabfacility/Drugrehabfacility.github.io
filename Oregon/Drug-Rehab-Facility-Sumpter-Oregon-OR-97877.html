      If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem.

      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal.Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible.
