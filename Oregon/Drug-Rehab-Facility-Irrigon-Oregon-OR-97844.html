      You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process. 
      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end.
