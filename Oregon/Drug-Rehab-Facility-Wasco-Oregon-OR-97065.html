      Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend.

      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe.

      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use.
