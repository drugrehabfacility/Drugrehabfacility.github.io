      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases.

      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches.
