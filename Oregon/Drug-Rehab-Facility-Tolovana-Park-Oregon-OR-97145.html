      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! 
      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. 
      Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program.
