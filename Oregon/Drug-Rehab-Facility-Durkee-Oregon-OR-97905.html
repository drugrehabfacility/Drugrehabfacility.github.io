      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. 
      800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.
