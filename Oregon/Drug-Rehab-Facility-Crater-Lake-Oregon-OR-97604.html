      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information. 
      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? 
      Why Our Detox Programs Are Successful If conducted improperly or without medical supervision, detox can be painful, even life-threatening in certain cases. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox.
