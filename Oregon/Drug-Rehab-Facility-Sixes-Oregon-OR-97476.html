Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.
