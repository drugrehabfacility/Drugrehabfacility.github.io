      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
