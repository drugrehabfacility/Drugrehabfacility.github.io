      Medical Detox Methods Methadone clinics are one method of medical detox. 
      Cognitive behavioral therapy: Your addiction didn’t happen in a vacuum. We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.
