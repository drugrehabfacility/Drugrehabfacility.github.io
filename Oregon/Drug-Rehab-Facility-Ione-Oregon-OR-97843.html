      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. 
      And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden.These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Medical detox centers offer inpatient detoxification services to patients who are already in the treatment facility or who plan on being admitted into treatment following their detoxification. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      2 percent of admissions to addiction treatment were for outpatient detox, 0. The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition.
