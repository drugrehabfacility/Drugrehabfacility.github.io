      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. More Testimonials Here Need Help With Drugs or Alcohol? 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used. Itʼs also possible that your computer has been infected with a Spambot virus thatʼs using your computer to gather information.
