      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses.
