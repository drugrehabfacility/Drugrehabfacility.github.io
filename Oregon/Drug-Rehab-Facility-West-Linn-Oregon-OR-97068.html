      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction.
