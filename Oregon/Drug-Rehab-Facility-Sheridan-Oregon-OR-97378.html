      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture.
