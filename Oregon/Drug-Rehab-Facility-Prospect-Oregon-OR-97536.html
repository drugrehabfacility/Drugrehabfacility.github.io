      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite.
