      Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. 
      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete.
