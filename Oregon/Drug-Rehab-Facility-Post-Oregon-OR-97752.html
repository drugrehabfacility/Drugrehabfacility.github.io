      Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in.
