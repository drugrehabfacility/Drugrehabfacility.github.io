      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.

      Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.

      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
