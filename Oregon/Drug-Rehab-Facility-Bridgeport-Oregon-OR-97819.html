      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      Holistic drug detox is an effective means of overcoming physical dependence especially for those who have underlying problems that led them into the addiction such as depression, anxiety or chronic pain. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. 
      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      Services between different medical detox centers can be very great.
