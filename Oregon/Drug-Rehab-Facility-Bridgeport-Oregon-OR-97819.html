      In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. 
      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl? Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Drug Detox Centers Drug detox centers specialize in providing acute medical care and treatment for those who are addicted to drugs.

      Living Your Recovery Ohio residents are no strangers to drug and alcohol problem. 
      You deserve to get the best possible treatment for your addiction.Aside from the outward effects of drug addiction, there are many negative physical effects that it has on the body as well. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day.
