      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.August 23, 2017 by Mark Adams Learn More about the Available Miami Lakes Drug Detox Facilities Drug and alcohol addiction may seem like a simple, catch-all term for anyone who has a substance abuse problem but there are many intricacies to each individual’s fight with their dangerous and debilitating habit. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      There are over three hundred drug treatment centers in Maryland.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Maryland.
