      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective.

While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option.
