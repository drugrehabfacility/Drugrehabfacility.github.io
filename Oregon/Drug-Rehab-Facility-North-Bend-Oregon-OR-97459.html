      However, if you are ready to begin substance abuse treatment and are cleared by our medical team, we encourage you to begin attending groups and therapy sessions during detox. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Those executive level centers have been selected which meet and exceed expectations. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built.
