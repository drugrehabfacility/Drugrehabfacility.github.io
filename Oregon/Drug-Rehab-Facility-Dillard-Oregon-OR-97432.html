      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 
      Need help finding an inpatient drug detox center? You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).

      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. The goal is to help you get mentally and physically stable. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs.

      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight.

      After detoxification, the patient needs to be relieved from the psychological, mental desires of thoughts that goes round and round, which always create a need for narcotics.This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process.
