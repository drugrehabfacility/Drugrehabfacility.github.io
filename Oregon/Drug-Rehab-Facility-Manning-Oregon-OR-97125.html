      Individual Attention The small size of our program, coupled with our high staff-to-client ratio, ensures that each client receives the highest level of individual attention during their alcohol or drug detox treatment. 
      There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled.

      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      By analyzing this information, we give an answer with the treatment plan and cost of medical services that would be appropriate for that case.
