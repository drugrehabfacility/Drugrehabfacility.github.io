      Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens.

      Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. Throughout your addiction, your body has built such a strong tolerance that it physical craves and needs the drug, and subsequently going into shock when it doesn’t get the drug it needs. 
      First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal.
