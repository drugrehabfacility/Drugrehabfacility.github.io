      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life.
