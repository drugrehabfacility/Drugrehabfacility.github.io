      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. 
      In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. 
      One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      Taking those steps, one day at a time, and practicing kindness is recommended for an encouraging and happy life in recovery. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.

      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
