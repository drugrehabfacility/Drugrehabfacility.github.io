      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program. They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. 
      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland.
