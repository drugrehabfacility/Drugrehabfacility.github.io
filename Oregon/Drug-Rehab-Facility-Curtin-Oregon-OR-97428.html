      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary.Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction.
