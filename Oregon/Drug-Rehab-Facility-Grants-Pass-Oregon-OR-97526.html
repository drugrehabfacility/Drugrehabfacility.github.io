      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. Some New Jersey detox centers may keep patients in treatment for just a week or two while others will keep them for a few months or longer. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain.

      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. 
      Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox.
