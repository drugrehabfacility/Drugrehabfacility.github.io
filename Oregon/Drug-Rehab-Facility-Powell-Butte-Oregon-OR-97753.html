      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance. This is not something you can do safely on your own.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Whether there are co-occurring conditions such as mental illness, other addictions or physical health problems.

It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.
