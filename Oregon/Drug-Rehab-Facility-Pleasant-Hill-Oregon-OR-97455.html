      Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
