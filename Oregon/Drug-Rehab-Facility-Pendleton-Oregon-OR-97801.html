      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
