      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment. Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.
