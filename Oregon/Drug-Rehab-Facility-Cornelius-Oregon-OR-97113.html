      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.Is it important while planning for detox to FIRST decide which option would best suit your needs. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success.

      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
