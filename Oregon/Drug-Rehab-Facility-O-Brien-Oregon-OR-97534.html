      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term. 
      You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7.
