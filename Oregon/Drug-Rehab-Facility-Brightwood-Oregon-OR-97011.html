      Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have.
