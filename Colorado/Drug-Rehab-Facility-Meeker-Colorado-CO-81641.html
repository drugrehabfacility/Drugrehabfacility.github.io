      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      Often with drug free detox patients are given vitamin therapy, body processes such as massages or even acupuncture to alleviate symptoms. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal.
