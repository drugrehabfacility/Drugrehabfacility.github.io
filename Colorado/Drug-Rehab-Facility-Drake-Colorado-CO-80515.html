      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. Reach out to us at (877) 262-6566 when you're ready for #recovery! 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. Your love and support is needed to help the person survive. 
      We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call.
