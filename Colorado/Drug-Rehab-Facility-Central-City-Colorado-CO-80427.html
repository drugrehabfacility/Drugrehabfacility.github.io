      Friends and family: The loved ones of those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol often want to help but aren’t always sure how to bring it up. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Willow Springs offers customized treatment based on your needs, with expert staff, including medical practitioners, psycho- and physical therapists, nutritionists and spiritual guides. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Then you shouldnʼt be bothered by this page for a long time.
