      Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist. The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
