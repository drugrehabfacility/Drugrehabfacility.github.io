      On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. 
      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis.In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78.

      The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery.For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.

      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year.
