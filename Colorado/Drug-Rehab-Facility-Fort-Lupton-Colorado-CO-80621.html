      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. 
      Soft Landing Recovery, Oakbrook Terrace (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Soft Landing Recovery has an “at home” outpatient recovery that specializes in helping those with addiction to painkillers and opiates. Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. 
      According to California State University-Northridge, an amphetamine addiction develops when a person becomes psychologically dependent on the drug’s effects. They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. 
      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it.
