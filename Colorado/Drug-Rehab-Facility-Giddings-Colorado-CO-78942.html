      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      Maryland Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Between 2014 and 2015, Maryland’s rate of fatal drug overdose increased 20. Although many people are still suffering in their addictions, many others have found a new way of life.
