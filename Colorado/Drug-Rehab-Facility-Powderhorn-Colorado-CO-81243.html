      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 800-483-2193 The First Day Inpatient drug detox stays can last from several weeks to several months. 
      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      In effect, someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has come to rely on the drug’s effects to cope with everyday life.
