      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle.

A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
      Here at United Drug Rehab Group, we can’t stress enough how extremely important comfort as well trust is in the detoxification process.
