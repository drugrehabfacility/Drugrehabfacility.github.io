      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. You will get numerous diverse answers on how to avoid relapse such as; staying positive, going to meeting or groups and staying associated to your peers. 
      You can get information about these treatments centers and their rehab programs from the Internet.
