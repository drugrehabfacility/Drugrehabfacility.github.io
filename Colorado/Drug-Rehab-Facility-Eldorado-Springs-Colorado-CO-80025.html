      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Motivational incentives: it makes use of positive things meant to encourage the patient to abstain from addictive substances.

      Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. 
      The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs.
