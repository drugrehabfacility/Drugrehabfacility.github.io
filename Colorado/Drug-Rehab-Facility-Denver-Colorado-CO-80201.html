      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well.

      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      On average, detox takes 5 days, but can range from 3 to 10 days.

      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. Medical Detox Centers Many hospitals and residential treatment facilities provide medical detox centers as part of their overall treatment regimen. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.

      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction.
