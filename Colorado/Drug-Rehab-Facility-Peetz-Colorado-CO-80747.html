      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.

      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington.
