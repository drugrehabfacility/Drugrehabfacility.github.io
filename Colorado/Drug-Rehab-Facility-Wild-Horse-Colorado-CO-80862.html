      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department. 
      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work.

      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Any centers offering ultra rapid detox programs should be avoided. Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. 
      By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function.
