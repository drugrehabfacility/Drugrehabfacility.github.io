      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland. Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. If you or someone you know is battling a drug problem and don’t know where to turn, please don’t hesitate to call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to speak with one of our drug abuse counselors.The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois aids individuals who are experiencing heroin dependency and needs medical activities.
