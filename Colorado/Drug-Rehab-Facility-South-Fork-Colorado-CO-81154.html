      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Often when drugs are used in the detox process they can cause other symptoms and problems for the patient. Their services are varied and include integrated care, residential treatment where each client has his or her own room, individual and group therapy, medical services and more. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment.
