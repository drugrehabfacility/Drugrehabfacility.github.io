      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      The recovery results has been quite remarkable and for the past few years there has been significant increase in the number of new drug detox centers, which are specialized in drug detoxification.
