      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction.

      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      The doctors can administer medications to reduce the severity and the duration of detox withdrawals. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat.
