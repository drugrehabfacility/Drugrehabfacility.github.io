      Several drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer drugs that are designed to ease the withdrawal process. We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. Cocaine withdrawal tends to be shorter, but can be intense. 
      These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine. Detox in combination with rehab for drug or alcohol addiction makes detox an extremely effective first step. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer.

      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. In addition to inpatient and outpatient treatment, they offer a partial hospitalization program for clients that may need care, including medical care, 24/7. 
      Their 60-90 day residential treatment program gives the client more than 40 hours of services each week and includes treatments like individual and group counseling, 12 step program guidance and meetings and more. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation.

    </h3>
    <p>
      All of those who are involved directly with the recovering addict will also benefit from their attendance in a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. 
      Doctors and nurses are only needed for medical tests and rarely for anything else. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Originally founded as an orphanage for boys in 1916, Rosecrance has grown and evolved significantly, and now helps more than 13,000 people each year. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.

      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment.It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Those executive level centers have been selected which meet and exceed expectations. 
      The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Finding Substance Abuse Treatment In Illinois Illinois has such deep and rich history within the United States, spanning from the historic Route 66 running through the state, to the iconic memorials of Abraham Lincoln. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
