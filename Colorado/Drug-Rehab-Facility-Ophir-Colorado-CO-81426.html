      4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically.The key is to find a quality rehab center or residential treatment facility. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences.
