      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own. These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process.
