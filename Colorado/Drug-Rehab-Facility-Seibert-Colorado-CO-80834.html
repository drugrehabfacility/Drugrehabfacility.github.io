      They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.

      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"...
