      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.

      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. When you are ready to face your drug addiction head on, Drug Detox Centers Cincinnati will be ready and waiting to give you all of the advice and assistance you need. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly.
