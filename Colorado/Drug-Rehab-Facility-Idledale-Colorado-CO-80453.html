      1-800-819-9973 When Is An Inpatient Detox Necessary? Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering.
