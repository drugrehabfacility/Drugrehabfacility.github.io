      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.
