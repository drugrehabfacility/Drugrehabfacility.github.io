      Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center. Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. One of the most prominent of them is that detox equals recovery from drug addiction. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have.
