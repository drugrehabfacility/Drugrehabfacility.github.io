      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs.
