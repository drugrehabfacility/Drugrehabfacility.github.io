      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made.
