      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. Specifically, many people struggle in the days that immediately follow the decision to get sober. 
      Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications.

Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem.
