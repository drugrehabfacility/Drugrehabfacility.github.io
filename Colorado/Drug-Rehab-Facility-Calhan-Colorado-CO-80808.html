      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
