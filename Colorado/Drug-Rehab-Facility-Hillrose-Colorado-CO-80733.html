      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process.

      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      How Do I Know IF I Need Amphetamine Addiction Treatment? If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer.The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible.

      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.

      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.
