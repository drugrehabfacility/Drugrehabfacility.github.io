      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Usually people addicted to drugs cannot detox themselves because of the severe withdrawal symptoms. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be.
