People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.

      It takes highly trained professionals implementing evidence-based treatment protocols to successfully attempt detoxification. We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. 
      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois.
