      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      If you are a resident of Illinois and you need to resort to the treatment programs meted out by these organizations, you will find the Chicago detox centers useful. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox.

      However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications. 
      There are some forms of detox that exist that are drug free, however the primary form of detox uses various medications to alleviate symptoms.
