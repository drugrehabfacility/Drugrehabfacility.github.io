      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug.
