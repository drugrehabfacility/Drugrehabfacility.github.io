      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years.

Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol.

      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      Generally speaking, an alcohol, tranquilizer or benzodiazipine withdrawal where seizures, major heart conditions, or blood pressure risks are high would involve an inpatient Hospitalization. A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings.
