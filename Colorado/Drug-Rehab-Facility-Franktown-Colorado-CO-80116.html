      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. In addition, the patient will have access to 24/7 nursing assistance. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Jude Retreats offers an educational based program that helps guests self evaluate and make decisions based on their ability to choose not to use drugs. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      Physical dependence is one of the most difficult parts of any addiction to overcome but with the help of detox centers and the specialized programs, medications, therapists and medical interventionist who provide care at these facilities, those who suffer from even the strongest of addictions can get past the physical dependence that keeps them using drugs or alcohol and prepare for psychological recovery.
