      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete.
