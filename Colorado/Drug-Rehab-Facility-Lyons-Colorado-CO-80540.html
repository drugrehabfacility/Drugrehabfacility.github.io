      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Call now to find a program that meets your recovery needs. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
