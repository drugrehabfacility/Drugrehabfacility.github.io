      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence.
