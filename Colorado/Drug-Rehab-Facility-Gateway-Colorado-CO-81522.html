      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. Counseling is also provided by the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts. 
      Medically Managed Withdrawals Many of the symptoms of withdrawal can be managed with medication. Withdrawal symptoms may include headache, sweating and chills, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscle cramps, anxiety, irritability and seizures.
