      If you’re struggling with any type of drug addiction, you don’t have to go through it alone. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking.
