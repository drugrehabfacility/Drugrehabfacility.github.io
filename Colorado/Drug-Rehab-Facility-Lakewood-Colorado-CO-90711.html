      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. 
      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      If you are suffering from addiction and need help getting clean, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with a drug abuse counselor about your options for nearby Ohio detox centers. These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings.
