      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.
