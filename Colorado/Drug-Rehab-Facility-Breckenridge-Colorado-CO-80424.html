      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process.

      You didn’t choose to become an addict, but you can choose to try and change.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox.

      Almost all rehabilitation clinics offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff all day and night.
