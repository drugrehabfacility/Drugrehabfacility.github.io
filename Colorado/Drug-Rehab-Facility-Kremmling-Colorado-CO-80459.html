      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
