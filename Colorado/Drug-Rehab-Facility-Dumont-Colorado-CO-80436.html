      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. These maintenance medications mimic many of the effects of the actual drug, but are much safer because dosages are closely monitored by medical professionals. 
      Addiction isn't brought on by the drug, but is brought on by biological and mental vulnerabilities resulting in a variety of kinds of craving." Step one would be to realize the addiction.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 
      A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington.
