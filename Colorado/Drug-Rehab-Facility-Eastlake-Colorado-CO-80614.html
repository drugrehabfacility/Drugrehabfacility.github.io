      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. 
      A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Your loved one is locked in a desperate struggle that they might not even be aware of and they need your help. They have a network of successful programs to help those with addiction, including detox, inpatient and outpatient care, halfway houses, recovery homes, and sober living facilities.

      The CORE (Connecticut Opioid Response Initiative) aims to combat the use and overdose of opioids including heroin, fentanyl and other prescriptions. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Find a drug or #alcohol detox program that's right for you or a loved one.
