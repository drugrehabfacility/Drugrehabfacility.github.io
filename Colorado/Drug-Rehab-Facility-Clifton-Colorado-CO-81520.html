      Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Call us today and take the first step towards recovery. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Do you know someone who is looking for a drug and alcohol detox center in Illinois? The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
