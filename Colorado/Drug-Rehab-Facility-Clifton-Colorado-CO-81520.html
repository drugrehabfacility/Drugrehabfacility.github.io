      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate.

      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. 
      The staff there will be able to develop a comprehensive treatment plan and help the individual get to the bottom of their addictions. Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      These providers should regularly check in with individuals and evaluate that the care being provided is sufficient and beneficial. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
