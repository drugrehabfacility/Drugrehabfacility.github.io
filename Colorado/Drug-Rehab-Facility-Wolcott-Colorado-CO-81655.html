      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Serving a fellow person in recovery is a fantastic way to continue to be happy in recovery. Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
