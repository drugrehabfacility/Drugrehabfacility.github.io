      Look for detox centers nearest your home, friends, and family, or in another part of Ohio away from distractions and negative influences. These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. 
      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.

      You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. When people leave their comfort zone they can begin a new life away from the temptations and people that contributed to their abuse. 
      Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free.
