      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. Scroll down this page to get more information or help with admission into private pay detox or rehab centers and pricing info... 
      In some cases, withdrawl can put your life at risk. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you.

      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. 
      3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates.

      Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely.Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. A detox facility may require a referral from a primary care or other health provider before providing services. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems.

      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.Home Detox Centers Detox Centers Detox centers provide effective detoxification programs and methods to assist those who suffer from drug or alcohol addiction in finding the strength to make their way through the withdrawal symptoms and come out on top of addiction. The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs.
