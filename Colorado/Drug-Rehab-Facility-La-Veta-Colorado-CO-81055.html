      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM.
