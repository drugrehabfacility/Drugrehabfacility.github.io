      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox.

      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge.
