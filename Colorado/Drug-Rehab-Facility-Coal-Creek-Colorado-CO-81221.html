      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. A non medically supervised detox facility may have trained or certified staff members, but there are not any medications provided to alleviate symptoms. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
