      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      As important as detox is, it is only ONE piece of the puzzle.

      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis.Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      There are also other types of programs available that incorporate many modalities to achieving sober success for a lifetime.All over the United States, drug abuse or heroin abuse are still increasing, that’s why the program of Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts still fights the prevention of addiction.
