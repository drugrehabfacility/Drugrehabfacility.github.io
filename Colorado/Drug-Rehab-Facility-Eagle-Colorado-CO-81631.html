      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Counseling results to intervention which involves seeking professional help by the concerned parties to give the patient the necessary treatment. 
      This is a painful process but this is an effective way to treat addiction. Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78.
