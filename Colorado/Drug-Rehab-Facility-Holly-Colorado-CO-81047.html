      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. 
      An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      This unique approach to drug rehab focuses on blunting the withdrawal symptoms that can make getting off drugs or alcohol such a difficult and often painful process.Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol.The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. This is especially the case when addiction has developed.
