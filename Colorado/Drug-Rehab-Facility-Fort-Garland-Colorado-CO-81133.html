      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps.Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM.

      Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. You can also choose to take advantage of our in-home drug detox programs, which bring the benefits of our facilities to the comfort of your private residence. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. 
      That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines.
