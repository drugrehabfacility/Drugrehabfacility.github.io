      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program.
