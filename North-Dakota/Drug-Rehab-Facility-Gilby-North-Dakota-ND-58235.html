Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
