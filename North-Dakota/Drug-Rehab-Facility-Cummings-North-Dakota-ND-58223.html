      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways.

      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse.It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.

      1,835 people are estimated to have died from drug overdose in 2015. Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 
      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out.
