      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. These products claim to ease the path to sobriety through herbs, tinctures, and vitamins, allowing for clean urine tests and a healthy body. 
      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method.

      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager.

Life is too short to let it pass us by giving us a call and we will work together to show you the life you deserve without the need for any addiction. 
      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out.

      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
