      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. These centers ensure a successful withdrawal as well as successful recovery. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.
