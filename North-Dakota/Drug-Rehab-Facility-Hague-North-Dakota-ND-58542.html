      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. The environment provided is one that will help take you through the rehab process without the risk of a relapse once treatment is complete. 
      Non medical detoxification includes vitamin therapy, meditation therapy, group meetings and acupuncture. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients.
