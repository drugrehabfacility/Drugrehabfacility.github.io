      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 31,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for alcohol use disorders in Massachusetts.
