      Paying for Treatment Options for paying for amphetamine rehab in Massachusetts are many, though health insurance coverage offers the most comprehensive and convenient method. For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. 
      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
