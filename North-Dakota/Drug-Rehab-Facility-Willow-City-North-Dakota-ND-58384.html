      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      As the various pitfalls and danger zones of recovery are discussed the newly recovering addict has the opportunity to gain knowledge they would otherwise have to gain by facing these pitfalls unprepared, on their own. As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. 
      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school. This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. 
      Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs.
