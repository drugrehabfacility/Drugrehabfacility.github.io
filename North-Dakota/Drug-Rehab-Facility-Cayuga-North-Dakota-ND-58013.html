      Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Other qualifications may include residence in the state where treatment is provided, certain social qualifiers, such as being pregnant or a veteran, or being a member of the faith community that runs a faith-based rehab. You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others.
