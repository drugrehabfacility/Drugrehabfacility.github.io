      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). In the various Hartford drug detox centers, there are programs available for drug detoxification in inpatient as well as outpatient environments. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery.
