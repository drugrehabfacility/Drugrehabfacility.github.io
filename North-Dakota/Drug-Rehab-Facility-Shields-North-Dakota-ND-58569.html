      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.
