    <p>
      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.
