      How can alcohol detox and drug detoxification programs be helpful? And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. 
      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact.

      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. It is at this point that we see the onset of addiction. 
      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death. 
      In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process.
