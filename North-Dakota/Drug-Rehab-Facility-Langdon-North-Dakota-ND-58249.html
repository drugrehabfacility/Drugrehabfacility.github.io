      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach.
