      It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. The objective of the client should be to achieve healthy recovery. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.
