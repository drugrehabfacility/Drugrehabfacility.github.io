      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.
