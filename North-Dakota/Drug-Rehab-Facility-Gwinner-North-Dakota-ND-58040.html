      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own.

      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.
