      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. 
      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. 
      Therefore distinguish between medically forcing you through a detox and supporting or healing you to recovery. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
