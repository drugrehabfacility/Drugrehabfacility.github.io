      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too.

      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".

      If you are one of those people who is asking about the importance of drug detox, consider this—without drug detox, the individual is still physically addicted to drugs when they enter rehab which means that they cannot effectively focus on psychological recovery unless they have already achieve physical recovery. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology.

      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.
