      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. These groups are most often free, requiring no dues. 
      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      According to the latest N-SSATS report, there has been an addition of 313 new treatment facilities for substance abuse in Massachusetts. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use.
