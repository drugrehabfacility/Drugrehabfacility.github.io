      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. Addiction and substance abuse can feel like a never-ending battle. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. However, if you are like most individuals and families you want to find drug detox centers near me and you want to know what type of health insurance plan will cover treatments for your loved one.
