      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      These pharmaceutical drugs are designed to blunt the effects of the physical withdrawal symptoms that can make regular detox so difficult. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
