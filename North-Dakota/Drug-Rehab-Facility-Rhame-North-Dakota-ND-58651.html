      1 people per 100,000 are killed in drug overdose related incidents, which is triple the number from 1999. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Rest assured many insurance plans such as private insurance, employer medical insurance, the ACA Affordable Care Act, PPO’s and Obama Care will cover both inpatient and outpatient drug rehab programs. 
      If you’ve been a heavy drinker for a long time, you can start detoxing within 6 hours of your last drink. This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs. These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
