      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. Sober house living: Just like residential treatment, this treatment program involves intensive treatment while the patient is still among other recovering addicts living in a good supportive environment. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help.

      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction. 
      When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves.No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction.

      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      Over time, the human body recognizes this fact and stops making these feel-good chemicals on its own.
