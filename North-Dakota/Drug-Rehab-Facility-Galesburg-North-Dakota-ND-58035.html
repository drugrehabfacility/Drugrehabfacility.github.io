      And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. Inpatient detox programs provide 24-hour care and monitoring, which may well be necessary considering how amphetamine withdrawal can bring on extremely uncomfortable symptoms, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Further, in the report, it was also mentioned with the increase in the number of Massachusetts detox centers, number of people admitted to these facilities also increased to around 36,815. 
      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription.
