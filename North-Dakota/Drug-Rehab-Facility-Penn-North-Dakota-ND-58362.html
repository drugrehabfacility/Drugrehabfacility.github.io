      In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain.
