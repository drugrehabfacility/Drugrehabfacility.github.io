      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs? They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Motivational incentives: it makes use of positive things meant to encourage the patient to abstain from addictive substances.
