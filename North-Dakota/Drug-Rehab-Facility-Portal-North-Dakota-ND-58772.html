      Drug use has escalated over the past decade in Massachusetts. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. Community-based programs sponsored by organizations like the Salvation Army and St. 
      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it. 
      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      Prescription of medicine like opiate and mix medicine of Clonidine and Naltrexone are given. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox.

      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. Of course, the patient also has to do a great deal of work too in order to get better. 
      Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale.
