      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      A question that is commonly asked is why someone would start using, if they know how dangerous it is. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. We have access to the most efficient drug and alcohol Detox centers in the country. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling.

      You can get information about these treatments centers and their rehab programs from the Internet. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.
