      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. 
      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery.

    <p>
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
