      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being. 
      The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. We can help you determine what option is best for you. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care? The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
