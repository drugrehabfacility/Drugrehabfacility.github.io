      723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. 
      Before understanding how it affects families it's important to understand the notion of alcoholism itself. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s).
