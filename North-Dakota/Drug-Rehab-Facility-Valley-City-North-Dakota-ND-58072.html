      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      As a result, the individual experiences uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms during detox. The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. 
      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment. While detox might never be pleasant, our program can help to ensure that you move through the process without experiencing a life-threatening complication, and when you are clean and sober, we can provide you with a suite of life-changing therapies that can help you to stay healthy for good.
