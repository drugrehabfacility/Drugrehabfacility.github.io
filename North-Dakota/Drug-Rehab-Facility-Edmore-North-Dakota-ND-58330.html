      Naturally Assisted Detox Programs Naturally assisted withdrawal and detox can and should involve mega nutrients, lots of water and rest to allow the body and mind to recover from the damaging effects of drug and alcohol abuse. 
      Finding a treatment center located away from home gets you away from negative influences and out of your routine. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse.
