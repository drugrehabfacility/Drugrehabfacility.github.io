      Jude's Guidance CT Drug Detox Options Making the decision to seek drug detoxification for your drug use is a step toward rebuilding your life without drugs. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      When your drug detox is complete, you may want to consider enrolling in a program that will help you continue to rebuild your life. In some cases, SAMHSA also provides grants for treatment that can be provided through the state or treatment center. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. But sometimes, that confuses our minds to thinking that being drunk can make everything easy. 
      Contact us today to find the right program for you or a loved one.
