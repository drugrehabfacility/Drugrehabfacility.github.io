      When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult. 
      Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. 
      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab.

      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center.Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage.

      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict.

      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage. 
      After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own.
