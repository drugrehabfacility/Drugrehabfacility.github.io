      Factors that affect the length of alcohol detox: Amount of alcohol consumed on a daily basis Frequency of alcohol intake Length of time the patient was abusing alcohol Patient’s weight, age, and overall nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders Whether other substances were being used with alcohol Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually begin within eight hours of the last drink, and peak at between 24 and 72 hours after the last drink. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
