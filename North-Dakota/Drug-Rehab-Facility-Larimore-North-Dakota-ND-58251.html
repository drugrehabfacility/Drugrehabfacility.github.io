      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. Alcoholism is on the more serious end of the scale. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. 
      Sterling House in Akron, Ohio, is one such center.
