      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. 
      A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      Round-the-Clock Care – You’ll be monitored around the clock by staff that will check vital signs and make sure that you feel comfortable and cared for.
