      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Encouragement and emotional support during detox are important as well.

      Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. Some centers may seek additional credentials and certifications, proving excellence above and beyond what is required as well. 
      Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.
