      The primary goals of any detox treatment program are to: Safely relieve the immediate symptoms of withdrawal Treat serious medical or psychiatric conditions that are present However, the ultimate goal of detox is to prepare for the mental, physical and spiritual work of rehab. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically.

      I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE!
