      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. 
      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. Even if you are not at risk, you may feel extremely sick or very uncomfortable, which significantly increase your risk of relapse and cause you to start drinking or using drugs again. 
      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.
