      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      Those who get treated and then quit going to meetings since they believe they're " cured " almost always return to drinking eventually. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention.
