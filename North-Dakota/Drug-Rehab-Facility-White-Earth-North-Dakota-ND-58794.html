      For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. Detox facilities in Washington combine medicine, holistic therapy and the best clinical staff in order to create a very comfortable and quick detox from drugs and alcohol. 
      At these meetings, you'll find the loving support of women and men that are currently fighting with similar difficulties and discover how they've learned to look after themselves. That is why our clinical specialists are always on standby, ready to assist you in all that you need. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs.
