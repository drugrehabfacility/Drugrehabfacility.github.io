      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Programs for addiction treatment that are based in a hospital are usually located in a hospital for those who have developed acute or chronic psychiatric or medical problems.
