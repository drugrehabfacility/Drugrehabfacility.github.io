      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics The most used illicit drugs in Illinois are heroin, cocaine and marijuana. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery.
