      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field.

      But that doesn’t mean a detox program for alcohol dependence and abuse will last this length of time for every patient. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. 
      With lovely rural areas and bustling industrious cities, there is much to see and do no matter if you love the city life or the country life. 
      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body.A: Yes, we offer a private detox suite option for individuals that need extra privacy. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse.
