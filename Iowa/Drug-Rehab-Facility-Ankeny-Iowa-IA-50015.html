      Integrated and Holistic: I define the best Integrated detox centers as specialists in natural medicine and alternative medical treatments. Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.

      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain.
