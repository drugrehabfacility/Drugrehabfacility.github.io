      Call (866) 578-7471 today to reach a professional interventionist. Call Now (888) 365-2740 Questions about treatment? 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery.

      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary.Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control. 
      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
