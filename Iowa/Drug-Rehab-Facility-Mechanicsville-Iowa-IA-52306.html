      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency.

      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong.
