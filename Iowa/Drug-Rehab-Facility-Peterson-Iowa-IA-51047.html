      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 5 percent of people in addiction treatment were seeking outpatient detox, 0. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. 
      The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.

      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. In 2010, over 3,000 adults died due to an overdose of prescription drugs. 
      Natural Treatment for Drug Addiction Natural detox is still a popular form of overcoming one’s physical addiction to drugs. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      However, some cases are complex and it is essential to be well prepared for any possibility, no matter how slight. In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.
