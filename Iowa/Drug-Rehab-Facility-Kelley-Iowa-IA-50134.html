      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      You could be submitting a large number of automated requests to our search engine. This treatment program is offered for 3-5 days a week and between 4-6 hours per day. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse.

      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse.

      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. 
      The detoxification process for substance abuse including drug and alcohol addiction can be psychologically and physically difficult.Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox.

      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.
