      Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort.

      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives.
