      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      These body detoxification treatments are very effective in doing away with the harmful effects of drug and alcohol. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      Ohio detox centers often provide counseling and support group therapy so you can overcome psychological causes of addiction. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
