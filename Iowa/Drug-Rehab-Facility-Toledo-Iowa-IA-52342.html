      If you’re looking for impartial advice on how to find the best alcohol and drug detox facilities in Connecticut, CT @cta. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
