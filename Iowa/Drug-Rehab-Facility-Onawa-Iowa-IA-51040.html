      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. 
      We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. Remember when I had to run after you making excuses and trying to get you to take a shower when you were just a girl?
