      Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      It is possible to find many alcoholics in every area.
