      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Outpatient medical detox used methadone and suboxone replacement therapies. Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. These evaluations and treatment programs are conducted by our licensed medical personnel to ensure a successful and health transition to recovery. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. 
      Run through the features of these treatment centers and try to find a detoxification program that suits your needs.
