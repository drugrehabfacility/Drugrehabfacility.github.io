      Home-Like Comfort – Far from a stark, hospital-like environment, our drug and alcohol detox facilities are home-like and welcoming. Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment. An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. 
      This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you.

      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. 
      Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois.
