We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Having an inpatient detox treatment allows you to spend some time away from your habitual environment, which is beneficial when your surrounding circumstances are responsible for the alcohol and substance abuse that led you to addiction.

Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      After transferring to the recovery room, patients continue to receive private duty bedside nursing care and continued monitoring by the physician who is present until discharge. Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed.
