      Drug And Alcohol Rehab </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. 
      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. 
      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones.

      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE!

Some providers may prescribe sleeping medications for the most severe cases where the cravings for the drugs threaten to derail any attempts at detoxification. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.

      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
