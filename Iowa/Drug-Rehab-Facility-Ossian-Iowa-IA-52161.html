An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process.Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away.
