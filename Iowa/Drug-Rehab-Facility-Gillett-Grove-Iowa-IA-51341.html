      To me, the personal attention I received helped me understand my priorities. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      When you enter a Connecticut detox center you will be faced with a wide range of options that are aimed at helping you to overcome withdrawal and prepare physically for the challenges of psychological recovery and healing. That’s why we’re here – to guide you along the path to recovery, one step at a time. 
      While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated.
