      Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far.
