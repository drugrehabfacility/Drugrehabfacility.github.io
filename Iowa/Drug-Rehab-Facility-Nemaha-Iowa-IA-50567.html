      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits. Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. 
      This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery.
