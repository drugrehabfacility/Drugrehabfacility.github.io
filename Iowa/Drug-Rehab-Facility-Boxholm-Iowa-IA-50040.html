      Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings. 
      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose. 
      But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go.
