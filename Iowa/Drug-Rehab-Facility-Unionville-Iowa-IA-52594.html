Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. 
      At a residential inpatient service, you can enjoy a comfortable setting to live in while receiving medical attention and alternative therapies that contribute with your overall wellbeing. However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
