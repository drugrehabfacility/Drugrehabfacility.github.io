      Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. When you call us you will be speaking with someone who has struggled with a substance abuse problem themselves.

      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence.
