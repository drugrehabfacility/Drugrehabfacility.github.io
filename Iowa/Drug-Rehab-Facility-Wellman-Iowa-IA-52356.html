      Let us help you find the right #addiction treatment program. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. 
      Don’t fall victim to this statistic, call 800-483-2193 today and we’ll connect you with a detox specialist that can answer your questions and help you find a center that’s able to assist in your recovery process. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat.
