      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. The one on one counseling sessions offer the addict the opportunity to acclimate himself to the process of therapy. 
      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts.

That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused.
