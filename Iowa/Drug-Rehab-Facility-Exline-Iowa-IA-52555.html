      Free detox treatment options are there to ensure that everyone has access to needed rehab care regardless of financial means. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      Detox is generally considered to be the first step in a treatment program and should be followed with a complete substance abuse treatment program. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief.

      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), drug detoxification (or “detox”) is the process of removing the drug from the body.
