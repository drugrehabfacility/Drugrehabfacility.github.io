      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits.
