      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies. Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Regardless, the most profound benefit of drug detox rehab is the sobriety that comes after the hard work and effective therapy that is received.One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
