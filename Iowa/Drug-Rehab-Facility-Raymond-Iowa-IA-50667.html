      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The most positive thing about drug free detox is that it does not carry with it dangerous side effects for the patient.

      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released.

      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees.
