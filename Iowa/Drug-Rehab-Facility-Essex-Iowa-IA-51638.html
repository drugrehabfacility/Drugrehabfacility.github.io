      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.

      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction.
