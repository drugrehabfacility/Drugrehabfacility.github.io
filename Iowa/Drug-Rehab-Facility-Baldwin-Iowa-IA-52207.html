      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery.If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available.

      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. 
      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process.
