      Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.

      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal.
