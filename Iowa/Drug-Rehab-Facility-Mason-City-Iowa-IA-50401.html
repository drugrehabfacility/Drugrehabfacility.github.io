      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. For people living in poverty and those who are unemployed, even homeless, and struggling with the physical, emotional, and financial cost of addiction, the idea of entering a treatment program seems impossible because there is simply no money available. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you.
