      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender.

      I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. Addiction is complex, and the recovery process addresses that complexity. 
      Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease.
