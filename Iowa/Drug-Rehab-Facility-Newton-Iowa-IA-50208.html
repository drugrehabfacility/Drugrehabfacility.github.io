      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol. Depending on the provider and the sources of funding, free drug rehab can include anything from intensive inpatient care to simple outpatient medical maintenance. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. 
      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
