      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. Some of the hardest drugs to come off of include benzodiazepines, methadone and Suboxone. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.
