      Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. In Illinois Detox Center Rehabs’ strategies are proven to be safe and clinically sound, and are well known within the rehabilitation community.   Take the First Step! 
      Withdrawal Symptoms Associated with Drug Detox Each drug affects the brain in a different way. Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
