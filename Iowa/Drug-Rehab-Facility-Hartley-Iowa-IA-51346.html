      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. 
      Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. There are no guarantees, except that you can’t recover if you don’t try. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry.
