      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      Some religious organizations offer support organizations for people in rehab, such as the Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement recovery program and its residential treatment center for men in California, or JACS, a Jewish community addiction resource group in New York, along with a number of other Christian support organizations, like Alcoholics Victorious and Christians in Recovery. If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing.

      In most cases, the trauma of these effects turns out to be serious enough to prompt addicts attempting reform to abandon hope and return to drugs. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      But, it’s incredibly difficult, due in no small part of withdrawal symptoms. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab.An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
