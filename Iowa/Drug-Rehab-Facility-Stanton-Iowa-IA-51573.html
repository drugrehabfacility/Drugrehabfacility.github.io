      You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. 
      The clinical staff can help each addict and alcoholic find what they need personally to recover.

      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Drug detox rehab is one option of providing safe and effective treatment for an individual who is addicted to drugs or alcohol and many programs also offer treatment options for the family members and loved ones of the addict too.
