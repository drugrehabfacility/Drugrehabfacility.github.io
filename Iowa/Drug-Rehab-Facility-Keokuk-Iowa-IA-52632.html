      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances.
