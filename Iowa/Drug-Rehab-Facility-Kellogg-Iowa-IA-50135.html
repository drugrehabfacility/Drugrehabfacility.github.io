      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      There are hundreds of drug detox centers in the city of Chicago. Detox can be a physically exhausting process, but at our specially run detox facilities, it doesn’t have to be. 
      Thank you again for teaching and coaching me to always look at the positive part of everything even if it only a small part of the total picture!
