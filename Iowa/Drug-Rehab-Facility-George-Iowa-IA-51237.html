      Medical Support Medical intervention and support are among the ways that a detoxification facility helps to ease the withdrawal symptoms that can contribute to relapse. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States.
