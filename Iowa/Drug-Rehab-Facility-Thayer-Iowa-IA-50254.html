      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. All detox and rehab centers have been thoroughly pre-screened by me and have passed many quality checks to be considered as a Drug Rehab Advisor recommended program. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs.

      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      Community-based programs sponsored by organizations like the Salvation Army and St.Willow Springs offers customized treatment based on your needs, with expert staff, including medical practitioners, psycho- and physical therapists, nutritionists and spiritual guides. 
      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy.

      For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. 
      Sunrise Detox is not a hospital or a psychiatric ward, so our guests are not locked in: We see our clients as our guests, and treat them as such. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.
