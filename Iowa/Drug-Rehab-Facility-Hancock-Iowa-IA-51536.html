      We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals.Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else. 
      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. 
      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.At Ohio detox centers, you’ll be surrounded by other patients who share and understand similar struggles with overcoming addiction and staying clean. 
      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing.
