      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      Call The 24Hr Addiction Hotline 800-454-6704 WE ACCEPT MOST HEALTH INSURANCE TAKE BACK YOUR LIFE If you or a loved one is in need of help, we're here.Detoxification is an important first step on the road of recovery for an individual addicted to drugs or alcohol. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Addiction takes over your life and destroys every part of it. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love.

      Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use.
