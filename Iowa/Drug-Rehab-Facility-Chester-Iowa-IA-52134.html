      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. 723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. 
      In 2010, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the treatment admissions of meth abuse and addiction were more than double the rates of admissions for heroin or prescription opioids. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. We can help you: Have you or your loved one ever experienced withdrawal from drugs? 
      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit.

      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. 
      The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016.
