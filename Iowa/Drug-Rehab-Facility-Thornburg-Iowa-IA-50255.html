      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Medical attention may only be needed once in a while, but this care will also be accessed at holistic detox centers as well. 
      Let Sober Living Drug Rehab guide and assist you on the right route to a high quality treatment program for drug addiction. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Now I appreciate life as it was meant to be, a pleasant experience. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there.
