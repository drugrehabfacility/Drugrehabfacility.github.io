      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. A program gives you support to guide you through the withdrawal. 
      It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. 
      There are a number of types of support groups which are available to aid those who are handling alcoholism. Detox uses a safe, medically monitored detox process that is extraordinarily successful, even for people that might feel terrified by the consequences of their drug or alcohol abuse.   Detox Is a Medical Procedure Detox is supposed to cleanse all dangerous drugs or alcohol from the addict’s body, it needs to be safe and monitored. 
      A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington. For one thing, a small number of people actually become addicted to methadone or Suboxone while they are trying to detoxify.
