      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. Expect wonderful add ons such as full suites, private rooms with private bathroom; standard rooms include use of internet, cell phones, prime locations, outstanding food and great supports. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.
