      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. For free rehab, the main qualifying factor is usually a demonstrated inability to pay. 
      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      With practicing kindness, while continuing to work on yourself as a person, you may find relapse prevention is an inspiring and gratifying.
