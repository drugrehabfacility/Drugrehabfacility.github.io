      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. 
      This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.
