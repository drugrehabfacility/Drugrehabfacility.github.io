      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction.

      Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.
