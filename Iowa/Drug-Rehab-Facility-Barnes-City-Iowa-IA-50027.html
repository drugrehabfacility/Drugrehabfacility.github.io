      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.
