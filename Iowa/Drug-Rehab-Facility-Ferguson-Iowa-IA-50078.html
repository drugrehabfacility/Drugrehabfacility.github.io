This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).

      The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using.
