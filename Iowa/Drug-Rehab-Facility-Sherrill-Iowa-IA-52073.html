      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. To learn more about our drug detox in Howell, as well as our other addiction treatment programs in Howell, call us today at (848) 229-9401.Home > Rehab > New Jersey> Detox New Jersey Detox Center Listings Substance abuse in the form of drugs or alcohol can spoil a person's life. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
