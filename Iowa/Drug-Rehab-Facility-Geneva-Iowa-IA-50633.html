      Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      These three substances account for 90 percent of all drug seizures in the area. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. A lot of individuals wonder if this organization satisfies them. 
      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs.
