      Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs. 
      Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. Either way, your first day will often be dedicated to understanding your needs for treatment and your condition. 
      Nagging the alcoholic really isn't the solution to recovery. The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. At this time, breaking from the shackles with all the habit would difficult for the person’s initiatives. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).
