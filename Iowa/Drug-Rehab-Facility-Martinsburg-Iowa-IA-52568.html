      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      If you do not stay focused on deny temptations to use drugs and alcohol then you greater your chances of relapsing. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.
