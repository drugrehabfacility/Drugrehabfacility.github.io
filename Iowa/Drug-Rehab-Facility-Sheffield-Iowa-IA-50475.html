      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      What scale or level do you expect the facility to be? However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      Call today and speak to a treatment counselor about rehabilitation.
