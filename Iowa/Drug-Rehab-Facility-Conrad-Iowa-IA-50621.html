      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. We provide the best-known treatment options for addiction – whether it’s inpatient, outpatient, or after care rehab you need, we can guide you to the path of an addiction free life. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      When a person has been suffering from numerous health and addictions problems, especially if they are on significant medications, a medical / integrative detox program should be considered. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings.
