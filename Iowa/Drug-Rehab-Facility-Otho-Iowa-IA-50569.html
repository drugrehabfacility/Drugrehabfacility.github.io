      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. 
      On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. Detox facilities should take this into account and offer tapering schedules, medication replacement therapies, or other methods to safely manage withdrawal. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.

    <p>
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Unless you struggle with DTs or other serious side effects of alcoholism, you should feel much better after about a week of complete alcohol abstinence. 
      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later.
