      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier.
