      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington. 
      An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
