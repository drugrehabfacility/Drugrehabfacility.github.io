      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.

      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. However, as the brain tries to adjust, it sends the person into withdrawal. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward.
