      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 5% of all Illinois residents admit to using meth or other substances in the past 30 days. 
      If you’re going to choose a drug detox or alcohol detoxification program, it’s imperative to research into treatment programs to make sure they match your specific and personal needs. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug.

      Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time.
