      An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. When the body is healthier and cleansed from all damaging substances, then detox can lead clients into therapy programs to develop lasting and permanent health.   How Detoxification Helps? 
      You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs.

      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs?
