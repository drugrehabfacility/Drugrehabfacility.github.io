      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

      The healthcare professional assures that the prescription of the medicine is within an inferior volume. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects.
