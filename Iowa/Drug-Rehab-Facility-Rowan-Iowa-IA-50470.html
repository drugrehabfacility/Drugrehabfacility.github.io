But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.

      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.

      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. 
      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. By the end of the course, the patient’s brain and body have had a chance to flush drugs out, and regain normal function.
