      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Our specialists will connect you with a detox facility where you'll receive high-quality detox care tailored to your individual needs. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 12-Step programs and non-religious self-help and support groups: While these groups are not recommended as a sole treatment mode for addiction, they are a strong means of support for ongoing recovery during and after rehab.
