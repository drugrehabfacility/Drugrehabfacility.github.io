      Our medical teams use the latest evidence-based approaches to make sure this period is safe and as comfortable as possible. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. G&G Holistic Rehab North Miami Beach, Florida 800-926-8043 - OR - Request a Callback G&G Holistic Addiction Treatment Program is a nationally recognized drug and alcohol rehab and treatment center with a comprehensive and integrated Mind-Body-Spirit approach to the treatment of addictions and co-occurring disorders.
