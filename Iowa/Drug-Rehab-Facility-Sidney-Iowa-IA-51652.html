      Replacement Drug Withdrawal Symptoms – Drugs used to treat addiction like Methadone and Suboxone carry with them severe side effects when an individual decides to stop using them. 
      Relapse is Not the End of Recovery Relapse is a part of a lot of people’s stories, if it becomes a part of yours it doesn’t mean you failed. Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision.

      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. These are proven to be far more effective than traditional 'modern' medicine. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Do Not Give Up If you end up slipping-up, make sure you are not too hard on yourself, everyone slips-up every now and then, you will need a learning experience to recognize your triggers so you can prevent relapse in the future. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin.
