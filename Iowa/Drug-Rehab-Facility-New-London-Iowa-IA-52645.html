Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.However, while Ohio may be as picturesque as a painting, below the surface, there are problems and issues just like anywhere else. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. 
      Many of these options are outlined below.   How to Start Your Search One way to find free treatment programs is through the government; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides a search tool that can find nearby treatment centers based on an individual’s address.Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage.
