      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. Most treatment centers have their own detox facilities on site while some others have affiliations with detox programs for their patients to use. 
      In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict.
