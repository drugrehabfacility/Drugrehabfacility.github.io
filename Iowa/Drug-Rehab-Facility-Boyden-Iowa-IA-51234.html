      The alcoholic has lost the selection of will in regards to drinking. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Statistics show that those who try to do it on their own without going to an addiction treatment center for inpatient drug detox are much more likely to relapse. 
      Searching for the right Massachusetts rehab center can be trying, and emotionally difficult. Plus Willow Springs works with health insurance providers around the country who may cover at least some of the costs of treatment.
