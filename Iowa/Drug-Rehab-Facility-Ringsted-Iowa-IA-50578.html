      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Without professional help, your chances of recovery are grim. 
      AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. In order to enable you to fully focus on your recovery, we do not allow visitors during your stay in our detox program.

      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.

      In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. A successful attempt at quitting depends on ability to locate drug detox centers run to scientific principles, ones that recognize detox as one step of an involved in ongoing process.
