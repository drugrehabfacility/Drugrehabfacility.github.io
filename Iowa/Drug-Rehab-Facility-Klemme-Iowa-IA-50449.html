      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone.

      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Living in MoCo is different than living in HoCo or PG. 
      Throughout your recovery, you should ask individuals who are in long-term recovery what joy means to them.
