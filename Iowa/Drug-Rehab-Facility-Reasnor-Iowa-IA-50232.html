      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. 
      In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. Based on our aforementioned criteria, including staff, food and nutrition, overall experience, and most importantly, the effectiveness of the treatment, we scoured the state for the best recovery resources and evaluated each one. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.

      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Ohio drug detox centers provide both outpatients as well as inpatients rehab programs. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance.
