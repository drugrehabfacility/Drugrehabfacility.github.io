      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). An addict’s experience during treatment may be negatively affected by their location, which should be taken under consideration when searching for treatment. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Due to the difficulty of the withdrawal, a detox clinic in Connecticut is also very rarely a methodone detox itself. 
      I expected a few different things with this scenario based on past experiences, but I did NOT expect such kind and compassionate mannerisms from Lauren and Bradley. At Axis, we hope we can help you to think of detox in a whole new way, and perhaps then you’ll be willing to tackle your addiction head on. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though.
