      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Patients receive the professional care and individualized therapy that will give them the best chance to fully recover. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.
