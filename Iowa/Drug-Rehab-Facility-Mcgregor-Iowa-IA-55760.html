      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. 
      One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.

      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      By putting the same effort in to your recovery that you did into your addiction you can reach addiction recovery. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. The patient is then put into a medically induced deep sleep for 6 hours and the detox protocol process starts. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug. 
      How can I choose the best among drug detox centers in Chicago?

      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. You deserve a life of recovery, not one in active addiction. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user.
