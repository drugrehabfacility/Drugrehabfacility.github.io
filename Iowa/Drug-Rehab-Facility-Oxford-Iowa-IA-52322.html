      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.

      This counseling process helps to instill good behaviors and help patients cope with any situation.The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible.
