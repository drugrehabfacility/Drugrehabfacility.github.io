      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. On a basic level, the assistance provided by trained, experienced staff may be the only thing that enables you to get through difficult withdrawals. 
      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. Many medical detox programs will rely on medications to try to ease discomfort.
