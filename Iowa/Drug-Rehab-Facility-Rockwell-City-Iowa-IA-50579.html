      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      IV therapy medical detox is seen as the safest and most effective method for drug detox. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. We can help you find a rehab that is best for you. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
