      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week! 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.

      Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. I showed Lauren this picture and said, “I think we glorified the cheeseburger too much!” She busted up laughing, and asked if she could go show her manager. 
      She looked like so deep in thought....just staring at it....then she let out a big ”OH I missed you!!” and started kissing the burger over and over again.

      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. 1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less. (AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play.

      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. Counselors are available by both email and telephone. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms.
