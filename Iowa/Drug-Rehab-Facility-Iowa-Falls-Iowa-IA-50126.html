    <p>
      Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. S. have become addicted to legal prescription drugs either as a result of being provided the medication for legitimate reasons or deliberate abuse. 
      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort.

      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well.
