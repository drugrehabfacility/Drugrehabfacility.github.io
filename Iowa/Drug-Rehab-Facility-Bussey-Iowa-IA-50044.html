      Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive.
