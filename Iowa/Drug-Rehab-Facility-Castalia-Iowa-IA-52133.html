      Center for Addiction Treatment, Cincinnati (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Center for Addiction Treatment is just that–a place where individuals can go to begin or work on their recovery. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
