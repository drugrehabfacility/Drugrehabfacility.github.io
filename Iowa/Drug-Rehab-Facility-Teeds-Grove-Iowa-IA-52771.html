      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      This makes for a stunning backdrop and a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities. Drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms Drug detoxification varies depending on the treatment but at Addiction Drug Detox Centers, counseling and therapy are combined to help with the consequences of withdrawal. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.
