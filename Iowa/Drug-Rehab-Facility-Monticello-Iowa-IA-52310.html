      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. After detox, the body usually reaches a renewed state of balance, and the withdrawal symptoms mitigate over a period of days to weeks. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications.
