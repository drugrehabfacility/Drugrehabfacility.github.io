      At Sunrise Detox you wear your own clothes, stored in your own closet, next to your own bathroom. 
      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      Offering a range of services that typically include medications, counseling and other methods of support, free detox centers are the number one choice for those who do not have a job or other assets to assist them in paying for treatment. Detoxifying from opioid dependency: Withdrawal from heroin and opioid painkillers can come with very powerful symptoms that begin within six hours of quitting. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms.
