      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming. An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. In the absence of professional medical assistance, most will fail in an attempt to free themselves from the grip of drug and/or alcohol addiction. 
      Let us help you find a #Texas addiction treatment program that suits your needs. The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.

      We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go.

      When the brain acquires dependency on a drug, attempts at even gradual retreat can come with disastrous results. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.
