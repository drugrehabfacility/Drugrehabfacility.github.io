      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Opiate Detox Centers One of the most dangerous and most addictive classes of drugs available today is the opiate. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. 
      We know that entering into a detox is a huge step to take and the commitment to treatment can seem overwhelming.
