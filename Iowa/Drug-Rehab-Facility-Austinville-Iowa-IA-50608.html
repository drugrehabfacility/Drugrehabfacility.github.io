      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.

      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe.
