      Addiction is a disease that disrupts normal chemical brain functions, enhancing emotions and mood changes and impairing the thought process. This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given.To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. These are often part of larger public or community health agency networks within the government. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment. Many people find that the only thing which will help them get through the withdrawal symptoms is not medication, it’s not family support or the support of a therapist—it’s the support that they receive from others who share in similar beliefs at Christian detox centers.
