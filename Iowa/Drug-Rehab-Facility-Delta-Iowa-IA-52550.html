      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. 
      Patients with a dual diagnosis can also find life-saving therapy here. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways.
