      Testimonial by Henry For a person like me, who had accomplished everything in life, I struggled with addiction late in my career. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.
