      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Cognitive behavioral therapy: Your addiction didn’t happen in a vacuum. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience.

      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over.
