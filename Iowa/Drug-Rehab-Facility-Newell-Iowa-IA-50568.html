      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs).

      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. 
      Although detoxification can be rather difficult, especially when detoxing from certain drugs, when the process is undergone at a drug detox center, the recovering addict can rest easy knowing that they are on the right path to recovery.
