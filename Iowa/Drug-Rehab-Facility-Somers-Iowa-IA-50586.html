      However, your exact length of stay depends on a variety of factors: the substance(s) you are using, the amount of substance(s) you are using, and for how long you have been using the substance(s). If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. Story of This Life uploaded a new video: Why moms get NOTHING DONE.

      This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      Depending on the medications being abused, detox can sometimes be done on an outpatient basis under a doctor's care. Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant.
