      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal.

      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.
