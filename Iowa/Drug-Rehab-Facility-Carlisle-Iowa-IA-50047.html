      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated properly. 
      Medication Currently, there are no medications approved to treat addiction to certain drugs of abuse (including stimulants, marijuana, and many club drugs). Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure.

      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home.
