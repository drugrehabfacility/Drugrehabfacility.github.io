      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Successful Detox: This means you'll get the most care from integrative holistic and medical detox providers who specialize in natural care methods. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances.

      The types of medications prescribed will depend upon the type of withdrawal, based upon the drug classification of the addiction. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. 
      Detox Programs Can Help All detoxification is done under the direct supervision of a medical doctor and certified nursing staff to monitor symptoms and ensure that any side effects are handled quickly and properly so that there are no major problems. If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"...
