      Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. 
      In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed.
