      However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. The highly-trained staff at Rutherford Alcohol and Drug Detox Clinic have years of experience when it comes to dealing with withdrawal symptoms, and are committed to providing a comfortable and safe transition process. 
      An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Unfortunately, more drugs given at many detox centers just cover up the discomfort and awful feelings of withdrawing from drugs and alcohol.

      Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Plus, alcohol is commonly used in Illinois, whether it’s at a family member’s home, at a café or grocery store. Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely. 
      It can go a long way in making sure that your sobriety is long term.
