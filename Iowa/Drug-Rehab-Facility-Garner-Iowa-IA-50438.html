      All of those who are involved directly with the recovering addict will also benefit from their attendance in a drug detox rehabilitation program. Individual Attention The small size of our program, coupled with our high staff-to-client ratio, ensures that each client receives the highest level of individual attention during their alcohol or drug detox treatment. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin.
