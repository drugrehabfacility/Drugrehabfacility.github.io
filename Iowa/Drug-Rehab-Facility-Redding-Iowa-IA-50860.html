      Rutherford, New Jersey Alcohol and Drug Detox: Your One-Stop Detox and Rehab Facility Most rehabilitation centers today require an addict to undergo a detoxification process elsewhere before enrollment into their rehab programs. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you.
