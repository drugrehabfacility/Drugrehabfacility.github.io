      Inpatient Drug Detox Inpatient drug rehab programs offer the most intensive level of addiction treatment, with round-the-clock physical & emotional support from medical staff in a safe and healthy residential facility. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. 
      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Whether you decide that inpatient or outpatient rehab is best for you, most treatment programs utilize similar modalities. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks.
