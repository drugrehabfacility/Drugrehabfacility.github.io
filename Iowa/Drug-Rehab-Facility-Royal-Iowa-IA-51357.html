      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. The state of Illinois is trying to lower drug crimes, drug use, drinking and drugging while driving by having special programs that are Federal, state and local government funded such as a program called Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC), which helps with the management of drug offenders to help lower crime and jail time with reentry programs which offers another way besides going to prison for someone who is not a violent person but has a substance use or dependence disorder with drugs and or alcohol. 
      However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression.
