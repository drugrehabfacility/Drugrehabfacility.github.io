      Jump to Section: Related Content Inpatient Facilities Cocaine Detox Signs of Overdose Alcohol Detox Withdrawal Timeline Dependence Basics People who use and abuse drugs may feel as though they’re impaired for mere minutes at a stretch. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. When you see how ignorant I am when it comes to new technology, give me the time to learn and don't look at me that way ... remember, honey, I patiently taught you how to do many things like eating appropriately, getting dressed, combing your hair and dealing with life's issues every day... the day you see I'm getting old, I ask you to please be patient, but most of all, try to understand what I'm going through. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery.
