      Timberline Knolls, Lemont (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Aimed specifically at women, Timberline Knolls is a residential treatment center that helps with substance abuse as well as other issues such as trauma and PTSD, mood disorders, and eating disorders. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role.

      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face. In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
