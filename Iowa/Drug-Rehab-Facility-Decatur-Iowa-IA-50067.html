      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland.

The holistic therapy includes massage therapy, the comfort of the detox such as good, filling, and healthy meals, comfortable beds, TVs, warm, relaxing showers and the more basic comforts from home.
