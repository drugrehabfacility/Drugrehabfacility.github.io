      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      Our experts in drug detox in Howell often see how lack of knowledge is able to get in the way when people struggle with addiction.  It’s important to learn how addiction happens, and how drug detox works. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. Group therapy helps patients learn how to trust, communicate, and realize they are not alone. 
      You Will Receive the Same Quality Service The fact of staying home during your drug rehab treatment does not mean that you will not receive the quality outpatient detox service that you deserve.

Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.
