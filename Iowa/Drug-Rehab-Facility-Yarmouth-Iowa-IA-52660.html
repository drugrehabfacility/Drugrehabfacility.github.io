What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.

      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.

Detox addresses the physical component to addiction but drug rehab counseling addresses the important psychological aspect of the disease.
