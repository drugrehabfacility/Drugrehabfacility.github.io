      1-800-819-9973 Anesthesia Rapid Detox procedure Or Ultra Rapid Detox,(AAROD) AND SOMETIMES KNOW AS (UROD), is a fast detox alternative to rapidly detox the body from opiates in 6 hours or less. (AAROD) is done under anesthesia and is done under the strict medical care of a doctor, anesthesiologist, and a nurse. These groups generally provide free 12-Step support or other counseling, religious motivation, and peer support group programs, but do not provide medical detox, requiring that their clients undergo detox before beginning their programs. 
      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive.
