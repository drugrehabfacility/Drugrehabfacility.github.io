      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.
