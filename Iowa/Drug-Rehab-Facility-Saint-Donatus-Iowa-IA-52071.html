Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.

      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. An alcoholic is not to blame, he born just like that.
