      Testimonial by Mary Ann I needed a program before my family gave up on me. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. If you or someone you love are among the many people battling an addiction, there is help available. 
      With lovely rural areas and bustling industrious cities, there is much to see and do no matter if you love the city life or the country life. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens.
