      Drug Detox Centers that Beat Addiction Searching for the right drug detox center is stressful and time consuming. 3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs. 
      The goal of drug detox is minimize and manage drug or alcohol withdrawal symptoms in a medically safe setting. The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs.

      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
