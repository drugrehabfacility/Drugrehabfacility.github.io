      Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. A healthy balanced lifestyle is a crucial key to maintaining sobriety. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Even the most well-meaning addict can give up in the face of painful physical rehab symptoms.

      There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. In these programs, patients are discouraged from associating with individuals who any addictive substances they wish to stop using. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. During this withdrawal period, individuals should have the support of medical professionals to help them recover safely. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance.

      How long you will need to remain in a detox program depends upon: The severity of your addiction The length of time you have been using How many times you have gone through withdrawal in the past Whether or not you are also abusing drugs The support system you have at home To discuss your circumstances and determine the amount of treatment you will need, call 800-483-2193 and speak to an expert day or night. Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. Some drugs look rewarding, no matter what you’ve heard, and it soon becomes a need for that feeling of normalcy, no matter how harmful the outcomes are. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.
