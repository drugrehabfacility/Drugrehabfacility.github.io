      Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. An opiate user (Vicadin, Heroin, Hydrocodone, Moprhine, Oxycontin, etc) will almost never be admitted into a hospital inpatient for there is almost no medical danger (outside of increased blood pressure) present, however uncomfortable the detox may feel. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.
