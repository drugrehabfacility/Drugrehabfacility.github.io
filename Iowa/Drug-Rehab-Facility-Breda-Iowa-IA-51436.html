      The supervisor (behavioral health tech) Kevin is caring and works hard to make sure all patients are safe and well taken care of. Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      The Detox Process Detoxification is the process through which the body gets rid a drug within the body, while at the same time managing the withdrawal symptoms that come along with it. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration.

Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free.
