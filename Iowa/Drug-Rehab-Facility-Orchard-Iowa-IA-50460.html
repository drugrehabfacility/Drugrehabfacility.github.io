      Friends and family: The loved ones of those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol often want to help but aren’t always sure how to bring it up. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. We refer to 30 different recommended centers which can be categorized into 4 basic withdrawal and detox costs. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. Smiling is considered infectious, so keep on smiling! 
      SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact.

      Insurance: Many types of insurance cover the cost of addiction treatment and rehab; in particular, the Affordable Care Act requires that insurance policies issued under the state health exchanges and through Medicaid programs under the ACA expansion must provide coverage for addiction treatment.
