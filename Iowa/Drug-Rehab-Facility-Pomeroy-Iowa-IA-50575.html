      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage.

      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Professionals in authorized facility can assist you through the withdraw process in a safe and comfortable environment. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. 
      An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.

      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. Some Out-patient centers are also delivering excellent levels of care and surpassing the results from longer term inpatient programs. 
      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward.
