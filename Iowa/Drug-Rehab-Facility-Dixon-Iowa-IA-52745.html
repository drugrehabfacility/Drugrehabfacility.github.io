      Detox is NOT the same as rehab, and should not be confused with other Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Illinois. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse.

      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox.

      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Rapid detox centers are rather controversial because they provide a medical based treatment that promotes detox but they can be unsafe and pose significant risks to the patient. 
      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you.

      New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS).
