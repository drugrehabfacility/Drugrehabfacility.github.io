In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.

      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Call our helpline at 800-483-2193 toll-free to speak with a specialist about your recovery needs. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      You will recognize a new freedom, go back to living life on life’s terms and repair burnt bridges. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.
