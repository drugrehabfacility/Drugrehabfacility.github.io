      The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. Usually, you can expect these basic steps: An overall exam so the detox team can see what kind of support you’ll need. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. You will also get a tour of the facility and meet the individuals who will be caring for you while in rehab, including your doctor. 
      It’s worth it to ask loved ones if they are willing to assist with the cost of treatment, even if one is embarrassed to do so. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Depending on what drugs you have been using, detoxification may be painful and take from a few days to a few weeks for maybe longer. We provide the best, most economical and efficient treatment possible for all who need our care. * Inpatient medical detoxing * Residential drug rehab * Outpatient rehabilitation * Subsequent alcohol and drug dependency treatment The most important first step to healing is cleansing from the compound. 
      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery.

      Detox facilities in Washington combine medicine, holistic therapy and the best clinical staff in order to create a very comfortable and quick detox from drugs and alcohol. During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day.
