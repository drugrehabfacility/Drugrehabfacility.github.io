      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. 
      Private facilities may be able to provide a higher level of care and be more rapidly accessible.

      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. 
      While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      The program involves a thorough recovery that lasts from the first few days to after six months and relapse prevention. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.
