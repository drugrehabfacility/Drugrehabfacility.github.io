      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. In this case thanks to the professionalism of the crew in Midvale, it made our day. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. While less common, cocaine, sedatives, and hallucinogens were also reasons for seeking out drug treatment in Nevada. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.
