Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.

      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.

      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      What is not accepted is Medicare, Medicaid and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO’s), due to the limits they place on reimbursements and treatment plans they allow.
