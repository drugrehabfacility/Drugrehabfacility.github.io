      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Getting Help in Illinois Do not feel alone in your fight against your addiction. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs. 
      You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation.

      There are only three ways to end an addiction: treatment, prison or death. 
      Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of. They are scattered through the length and breadth of Illinois. 
      A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms.If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. 
      This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. Doing stuff for other individuals and not expecting anything in return is not as hard as it seems. 
      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Detox programs ensure that their clients obtain the best possible degree of concern and supervision by employing medically skilled health care professionals. ‘Cold turkey’ is a particularly harmful detox approach that may result in diminished health and, in a few cases, death.
