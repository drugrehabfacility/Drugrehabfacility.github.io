      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system.A natural withdrawal is not a cold turkey withdrawal. 
      An individual must take part in a comprehensive drug rehab program to both achieve and maintain sobriety. The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Original text in Spanish and photo by Guillermo Peña.There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week!
