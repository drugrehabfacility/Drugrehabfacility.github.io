      Medical detox is a form of detox that commonly uses medications to alleviate some of the uncomfortable and even potentially dangerous side effects of drug withdrawal. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
