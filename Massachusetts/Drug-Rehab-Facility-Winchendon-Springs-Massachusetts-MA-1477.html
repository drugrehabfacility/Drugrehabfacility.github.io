      Therefore any intelligent natural detox program would include a large compliment of nutrients to assist drug withdrawal. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. Generally, you find programs designed to meet the specific needs of people suffering from substance addiction and alcoholism. 
      That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses.
