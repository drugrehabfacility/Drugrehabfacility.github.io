      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction.If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help.
