      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Give us a call, and we can help you sort through your options. “Your life is worth saving” Addiction has a way of making you feel like your life isn’t as important as someone else’s. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab.

      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program.
