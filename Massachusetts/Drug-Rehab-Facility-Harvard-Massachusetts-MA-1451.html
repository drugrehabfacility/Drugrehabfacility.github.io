      Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Today, you can receive the most effective therapies for you and your individual needs. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so.
