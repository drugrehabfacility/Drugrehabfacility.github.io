      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy.
