      Medications that Help Addiction treatment has come a long way, and inpatient drug detox centers have a variety of different medications that they can use to help people deal with withdrawal. 
      If that’s the case, there are other ways to help cover the cost of rehab, even at private inpatient treatment centers.   What Other Options Exist for Someone Who Can’t Afford Treatment?

      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program.
