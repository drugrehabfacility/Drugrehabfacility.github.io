      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. With a big smile and the huge love I've always had for you, I just want to say, I love you ... my darling daughter. 
      Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another. 
      They can use that knowledge in order to get sober through tapering approaches. When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
