      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Withdrawal is always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous which means that going through it in a drug treatment center under the care of medical professionals is not only the most successful method, but the safest as well. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs.

      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case.
