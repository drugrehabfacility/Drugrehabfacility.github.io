      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find.Their treatment programs are comprehensive and include partial hospitalization, an intensive relapse program and a professional program, among others. 
      Advocate Addiction Treatment Center, Des Plaines (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today For those who need medical help for a problem with substance abuse, it does not come better than one that is provided by a hospital.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      Although integrative medicine is easily the most popular and effective treatment strategy for any health problem, currently there are only a few integrative medical detox centers in North America.
