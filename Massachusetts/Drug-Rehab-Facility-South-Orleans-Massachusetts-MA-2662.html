      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. Stimulants, for instance, need a relatively short amount of time to detox. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol.
