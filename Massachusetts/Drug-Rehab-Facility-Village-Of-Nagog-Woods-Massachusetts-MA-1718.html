      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible.

      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question.It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. In the great state of Illinois, there are so many great things to experience and all of them are even better without the foggy haze of drugs and alcohol hanging over the mind. 
      In the third phase of treatment is implamantation of the implant. 
      Some of these include mood swings, irritability, drug cravings, diarrhea, fever, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and bone aches and sweating.The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Determining if a Medical detox is necessary before treatment for the addiction can be started is usually done by the trained and certified intake counselor and can in most cases be determined over a phone consultation 1-800-819-9973 or even through e-mail in special cases.

      Each individual insurance plan is different, and insurance can greatly help to defray the potential costs. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      Some people develop toxic, even dangerous, relationships while using that could prove threatening when you decide to change your life for the better. IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable.
