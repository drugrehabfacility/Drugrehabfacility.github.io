      People leave detox without dependency causing drugs. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. Get them the help they need so they can begin their journey to recovery today. 
      Intensive therapy and a strong support system are often necessary to overcome its devastating illness. This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. 
      For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox.

      We do this in a medically monitored unit, where our dedicated medical and clinical staff help to stabilize the body and prepare our clients for the next step in their recovery. Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. Most of these centers are equipped with experienced staff and qualified doctors who can handle these problems successfully. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.
