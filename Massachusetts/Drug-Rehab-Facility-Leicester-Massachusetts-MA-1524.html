      Call our helpline at 800-768-8728 to discuss treatment options with one of our addiction specialists.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      Some people who use drugs also use alcohol so it may be necessary for you to have the alcohol toxins removed as well. A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. 
      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. Those detoxing can also become dependent on these drugs and start abusing them. 
      All care providers should be appropriately licensed and credentialed.

      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      The length and intensity of detox withdrawal depend a lot on the individual and the seriousness of their condition. When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. 
      When not treated properly, addiction can lead to severe health complications, including fatality.  If you are ready to quit and you can’t, or have lost control over how much you use, drug detox is the answer.Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.

      Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life. 
      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
