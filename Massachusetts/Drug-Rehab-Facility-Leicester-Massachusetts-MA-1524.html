      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). Ohio detox centers understand how difficult it can be to overcome addiction, and will guide you safely through detox and withdrawal with a lowered risk for health complications. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. 
      Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. Some of the best outcomes result from clients taking part in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, Client-Centered Therapy, Equine Therapy, Art and Music Therapy, and others. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat.

      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. Opioid withdrawal can be treated with buprenorphine, methadone, or clonidine. 
      If you are abusing drugs or alcohol, you are not alone. Detox in NJ, especially for alcohol abusers, can take fluctuating amounts of time. 
      Successful detoxification is essential before long-term recovery can begin. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite.
