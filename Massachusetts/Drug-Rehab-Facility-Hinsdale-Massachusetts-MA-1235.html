      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. 
      Detox should be your first, but not your only, step in recovery. Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether.
