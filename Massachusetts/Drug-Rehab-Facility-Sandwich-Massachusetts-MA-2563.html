      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. Traditional medical detox can prolong the discomfort of withdrawal due to its sole reliance on medications.
