      The Right Massachusetts Inpatient Rehab Centers Our inpatient rehabs are the most successful, effective, and affordable treatment centers in Massachusetts. This is why alcohol makes people feel content and relaxed while stimulants can trigger manic and energetic responses. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Drug detox rehab is the very first step of a treatment process which includes acceptance into a drug addiction detoxification program followed by therapy and counseling at a rehabilitation center. Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol.
