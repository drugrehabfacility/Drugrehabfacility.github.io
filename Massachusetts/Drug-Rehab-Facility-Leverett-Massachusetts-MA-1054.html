      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. Illinois provides a unique mixture of natural beauty from rolling rivers, lakes and trails, as well as live and bustling activity and industry from the greater cities like Chicago. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased.
