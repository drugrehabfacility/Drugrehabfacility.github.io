      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      I’ll bring you some french fries to munch on while you’re waiting, ok?” A couple of minutes later, Lauren arrived back at our table with cheeseburger #2. As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. Drug rehab comes just after drug detox and includes therapy and counseling in groups and on an individual basis to assist the recovering addict in coping with mental health issues and in overcoming any psychological reasons that they started to use drugs. 
      Complete recovery is attainable, and people are much more successful if detox is used in combination with drug and alcohol treatment.   What to Expect with Detox?

      Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      Since New Jersey has a busy international airport and seaport, it is an attractive hub for illicit drug trafficking. In order to attain the same sense of euphoria as before, they have to increase their dose which could lead to drug overdose.

      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.If you have a problem with alcohol, you have more ways than ever to get help. 
      When you opt for a residential program, you can focus entirely on your recovery. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction.Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. 
      The Benefits of Inpatient Drug Detox at an Addiction Treatment Center Some addicts don’t realize how dangerous withdrawal can be, so they try to do it on their own. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      They may also wish to do a full mental health assessment, medical evaluation, and drug screening prior to admission. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs.
