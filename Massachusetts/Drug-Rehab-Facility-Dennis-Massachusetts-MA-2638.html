      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. 
      Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. With Ritalin, symptoms can begin hours after the last dose, and quickly peak. 
      We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
