      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. This service is dedicated to those who are looking to end the cycle of addiction. 
      But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
