      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. Over 90 % of alcoholics refused to check into alcohol rehab. 
      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.

      Today’s healthcare laws designate substance abuse treatment as an essential healthcare need. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification.
