      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Ideally, suboxone is used for seven days maximum and methadone is never substituted for opiate addicted clients. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      Often, these symptoms last for just a few days, but the misery can be so intense that people return to drug use in order to find some kind of relief.
