      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths.

The 38-acre property provides an attractive setting for recovery and contemplation, including comfortable and comforting rooms, a full gymnasium, and beautiful natural surroundings. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me".
