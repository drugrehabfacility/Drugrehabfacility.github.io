      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. They take drugs, they feel a change, the sensation fades, and they’re restored to normalcy. 
      Ohio detox centers will customize treatments just for you or your loved one based on medical history, addiction type, and personal recovery needs. Jude Retreats features an educational cognitive behavioral program that helps guests regain control of their life.
