      Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Free detox programs provide needed financial assistance for individuals who lack the means to cover treatment costs. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you.
