      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. The use of drugs brings about feelings of pleasure because drugs access and activate circuits in the brain that deal with reward, motivation and feelings of well-being. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you.
