      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. 
      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally.
