      As a very important thing, we organize the healing process when detoxification is painless, when the patient does not suffer from the pain, when he sleeps well and has a good appetite. During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. 
      Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time.
