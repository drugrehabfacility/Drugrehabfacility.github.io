      Naltrexone may be used on a more long-term basis for the first months of a person’s sobriety because it helps reduce cravings, and it also acts as an antidepressant. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. Further, in the report, it was also mentioned with the increase in the number of Massachusetts detox centers, number of people admitted to these facilities also increased to around 36,815. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services.
