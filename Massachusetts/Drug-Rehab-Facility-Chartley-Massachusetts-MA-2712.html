      Holistic drug detox programs often incorporate methods of alternative therapy into the program to assist with various withdrawal symptoms such as acupuncture to treat nausea, insomnia and other symptoms. C4 Community Counseling Centers, Chicago (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today C4 is a network of community counseling centers that provides aid and therapy for members of the community. 
      Many detox facilities don’t follow up with treatment and, without that support, addicts usually continue to use drugs or alcohol. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      Aftercare is a paramount component of the recovery process! Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life.
