      Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable.
