There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox. 
      A stressor or trigger could be rather simple, like walking into a grocery store where you used to buy alcohol or meet your dealer. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
