      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      What worked for me were the awesome social activities and the involvement of my instructor. A rapid detoxification was also provided for a severe case of addiction. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Call (866) 578-7471 today to reach a professional interventionist. 
      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      Soft Landing Recovery, Oakbrook Terrace (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today Soft Landing Recovery has an “at home” outpatient recovery that specializes in helping those with addiction to painkillers and opiates.
