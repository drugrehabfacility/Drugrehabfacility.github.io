      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Let us help you find the right #addiction treatment program. I told Lauren I knew it sounded silly, but if we could just order an additional one we will gladly pay for it because there was nothing wrong with the one that was originally brought out. 
      Ohio Drug & Alcohol Rehab While no single treatment works for every person, a unique process will be created for you. 
      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment.A long term or one week withdrawal symptoms is very dangerous to the person. 
      It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use.Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons.

      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem.

      A vital step in successful drug detoxification as well as drug rehabilitation is flushing out these accumulated toxic residues so that the individual no longer experiences unwanted adverse effects from the drugs they have taken.Addiction treatment is an essential step for addicts trying to kick the habit.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Maryland get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage.
