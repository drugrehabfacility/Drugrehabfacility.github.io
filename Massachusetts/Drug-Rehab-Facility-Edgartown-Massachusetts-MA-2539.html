      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Out-patient centers, where the person is cleared to begin withdrawal, are supervised everyday by doctors and nurses specially skilled in making detox comfortable. 
      We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels. While there are many different types of detox and treatment centers, the type of center that will provide the best type of treatment for an individual’s needs will depend on a number of factors including the type of addiction that they suffer from, their own individual health and the presence of dually diagnosed conditions that must also be treated. 
      Detox centers in New Jersey offer safe, professional treatment to those going through withdrawal from drug and alcohol abuse. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.
