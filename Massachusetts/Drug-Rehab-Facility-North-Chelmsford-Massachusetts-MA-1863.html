      Do you know someone who is looking for a drug and alcohol detox center in Illinois? 
      As the detox begins to take effect, the addicts mind becomes better prepared to participate in the drug treatment process. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. 
      While this is sometimes correct, studies indicate those choosing residential treatment in 48-day, 90-day or 60-day programs are less prone to relapse long-term. Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment.
