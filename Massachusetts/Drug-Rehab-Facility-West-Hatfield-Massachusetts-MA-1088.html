      Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse.
