      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      Different drugs contain different toxins; therefore, the experience of detox may differ depending on the type of addiction in question.
