      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. When addressing alcohol abuse, you should wisely select the rehabilitation center that’s right for you. 
      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States.
