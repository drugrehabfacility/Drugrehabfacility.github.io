      After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. 
      Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. While this seems insignificant, by her telling Arianna what she was doing, we avoided a melt down. 
      These symptoms can be either physical or psychological in nature, and vary according to a number of different factors including: How long the individual has been addicted to the drug Whether or not the individual was addicted to more than one drug The amount of drugs that the individual used per day The physiological makeup of the individual Among the most common physical detox withdrawal symptoms are: Achiness (aching joints or extremities) Chills and sweats (the individual feels as if he or she has the flu) Nausea (another flu-like symptoms) Restless leg syndrome Sleeplessness In addition to these physical conditions, there are also a number of psychological withdrawal symptoms associated with detoxification, including: Irritability and mood swings Depression Anxiety Nervousness Why Do These Withdrawal Symptoms Occur?

      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear.
