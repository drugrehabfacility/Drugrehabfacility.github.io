      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Residential treatment: This rehabilitation program involves staying in the rehabilitation center while being treated for drug addiction during the day. 
      This may be a last resort for some, and even for those who ask, the answer may be no, but it’s a chance for loved ones to be involved and invested in recovery. Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself.
