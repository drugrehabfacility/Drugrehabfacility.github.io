      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      Reclaim your life from addiction and start living the life you’ve been dreaming about – one where addiction has no role. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Pharmaceutical support to ease withdrawal symptoms. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 
      Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.

      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program.
