      When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries.

      Call our #Pennsylvania detox specialists today to learn more. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants.
