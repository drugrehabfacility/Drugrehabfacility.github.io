      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. 
      You will discover that a life lived clean and sober is far more enjoyable than anything you have experienced before. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      Employers benefit when an addict attends drug detox rehab because they are more likely to gain back a worker that will report fewer sick days, have fewer absences or accidents and ultimately be a better performing worker overall. Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. 
      Detoxification is not meant to treat addiction, it is to assist an individual to achieve a drug-free life.   When addressing addiction to drugs you don’t have to go through it alone. Many addicts do not trust strangers enough to open up and believe they are the only ones with their problems. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
