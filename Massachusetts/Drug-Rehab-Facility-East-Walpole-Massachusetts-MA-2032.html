Attending detox facilities in Washington are merely a beginning on the road to lifetime sobriety and certain steps need to be taken after detox in order for someone to find the success, peace and ease of healthy sober living again or for the first time.Drug and Alcohol Detox Promises offers medically monitored drug and alcohol detox in a home-like environment. 
      When you arrive at the detox center you will be met by the licensed anesthesiologist and nurse to discuss and prepare you for the procedure. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work.
