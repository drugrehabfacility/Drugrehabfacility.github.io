      Although natural drug detox programs may not be the chosen detoxification method for some, these programs do provide an effective means of treatment for those who suffer from many mild to moderate addictions. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey. 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life.
