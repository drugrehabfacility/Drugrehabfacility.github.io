      Faith and addiction recovery are a popular mix that has helped many stay sober after treatment.

      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. This is why professional treatment is so necessary. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. First there’s an assessment to determine which substances are being used. 
      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. Therapy is a necessary part of addiction rehab so attending it in detox can help patients prepare for the second part of their treatment if they are, in fact, addicted to a drug. 
      So, get out of your addiction’s crosshairs and find the treatment that you need to recover from your substance abuse problem.

      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem.
