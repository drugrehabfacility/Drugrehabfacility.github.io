      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment. 
      A good residential treatment facility will be able to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to the needs of each patient. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      It’s a rare occurrence, according to an article in JAMA, and less than 1 percent of people die during the process. There are a lot of services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, child care, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      The consistent strong desire to use may be too much when you see old friends still partying and using. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.
