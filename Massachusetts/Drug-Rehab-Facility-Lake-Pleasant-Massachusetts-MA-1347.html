      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. These symptoms can be either physical or psychological in nature, and vary according to a number of different factors including: How long the individual has been addicted to the drug Whether or not the individual was addicted to more than one drug The amount of drugs that the individual used per day The physiological makeup of the individual Among the most common physical detox withdrawal symptoms are: Achiness (aching joints or extremities) Chills and sweats (the individual feels as if he or she has the flu) Nausea (another flu-like symptoms) Restless leg syndrome Sleeplessness In addition to these physical conditions, there are also a number of psychological withdrawal symptoms associated with detoxification, including: Irritability and mood swings Depression Anxiety Nervousness Why Do These Withdrawal Symptoms Occur? 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. A rapid withdrawal from drugs like this could cause relapses and medical crises. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol.
