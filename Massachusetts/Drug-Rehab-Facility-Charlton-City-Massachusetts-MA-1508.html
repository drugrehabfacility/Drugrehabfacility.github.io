      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
