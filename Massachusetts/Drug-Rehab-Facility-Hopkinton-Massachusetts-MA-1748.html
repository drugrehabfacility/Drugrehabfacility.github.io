      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Like any chronic health condition, treatment is ongoing and it needs to be adjusted based on the client’s needs. 
      Which means that people trying these products for home detox are likely simply signing up for cold-turkey withdrawal. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers.
