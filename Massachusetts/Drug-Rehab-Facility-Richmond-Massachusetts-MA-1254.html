      Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. A good residential treatment facility will be able to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to the needs of each patient. 
      Paying for Treatment While the cost of amphetamine rehab in Illinois can run high, health insurance coverage goes a long way towards paying for treatment costs.

      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse.
