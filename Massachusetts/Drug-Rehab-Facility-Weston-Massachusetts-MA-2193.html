      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. You will be able to focus solely on yourself and your recovery while in an inpatient treatment center. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. Outpatient Detox Centers For those who may have just started using drugs or alcohol or who have a very strong support structure at home, outpatient detox centers can provide much of the monitoring and support on a daytime basis and then the patient can return to their home support network to continue working toward their detoxification goals. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs.
