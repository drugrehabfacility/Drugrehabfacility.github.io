    </p>
    <p>
      Speak with a recovery advisor about your choices. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional.
