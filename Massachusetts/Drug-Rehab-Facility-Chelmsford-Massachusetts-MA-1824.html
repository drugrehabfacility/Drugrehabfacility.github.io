      A heroin is really dangerous substance that triggers the mind as well as nerves of the person physically.As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. You may be given drug tests, blood tests, or liver function tests, according to the NLM.
