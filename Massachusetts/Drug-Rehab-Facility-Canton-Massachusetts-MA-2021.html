      Drug Detox Programs </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Attempting to rehab at home can subject the addict to painful and potentially dangerous physical withdrawal symptoms. 
      To find nearby Ohio detox centers that can guide you safely through withdrawal, call our 24/7 confidential helpline at 800-483-2193 to speak with an addiction counselor. The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective.
