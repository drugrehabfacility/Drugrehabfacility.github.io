      In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. Going through drug detoxification can be among the most difficult steps to quitting a substance. 
      If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with.
