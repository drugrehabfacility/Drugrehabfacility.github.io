      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. A growing number of drug treatment centers in Connecticut have services for the hearing impaired. 
      Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction.
