      Cognitive behavioral therapy: Your addiction didn’t happen in a vacuum. 
      Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. 
      Drug detoxification represents the defeat of the  physical addiction to drugs – and anyone who completes the process is to be commended on the achievement – however, detox is not rehab. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles! 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
