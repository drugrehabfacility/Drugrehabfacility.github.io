      Orchid Recovery Center Palm Springs, Florida 800-939-2891 - OR - Request a Callback The Orchid Recovery Center is located in Palm Springs, FL and provides residential detox and rehab treatment to women. No matter the drugs being used or alcohol problems being experienced an individual can safely come off of these substances and start on the road to recovery. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. Alcohol and Drug Detox Tailored to You Like the rest of the treatment experience at Promises, drug detox is carefully tailored to your specific needs. 
      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. Once the procedure is complete the patient usually stays for 24-48 hours for observation and monitoring to make sure that the detox was successful. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them.
