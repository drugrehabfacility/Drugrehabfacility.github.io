      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. Meth lab seizures increased more than 100% in a single year after 2012. 
      Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. 
      Entering into a treatment program will be the best decision you can ever make to handle addiction. This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Massachusetts. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
