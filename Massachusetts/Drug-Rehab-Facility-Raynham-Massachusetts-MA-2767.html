      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.

      Sober Solutions does not endorse nor advocate the use of methadone clinics. The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.

      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      To practice kindness, you need to be of service to others.There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available.
