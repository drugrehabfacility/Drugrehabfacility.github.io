      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. 
      Designed to reduce withdrawal symptoms for individuals dependent on heroin, methadone, Oxycontin, opium, Percocet / Percodan or codeine, anesthesia assisted opiate detoxification allows for engagement in a variety of aftercare programs aimed at placing drug addiction into remission. Drug detox in NJ may take even more time than alcohol withdrawal, depending on the drug of abuse.

      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility. 
      Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life.
