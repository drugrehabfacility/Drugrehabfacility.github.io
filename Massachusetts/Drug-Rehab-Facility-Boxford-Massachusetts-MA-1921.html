      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs? The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Only about 1% of medical detox center staff and doctors are holistically trained or fitted for integrative medicine and assessment.
