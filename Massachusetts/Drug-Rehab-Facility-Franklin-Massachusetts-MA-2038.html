      Facing Drug and Alcohol Addiction in Ohio Ohio has delivered many treasures to the United States. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. 
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help.
