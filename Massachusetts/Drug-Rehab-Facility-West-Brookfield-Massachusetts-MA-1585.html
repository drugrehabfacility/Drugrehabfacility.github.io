      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. We will address any other medical issues that may come up for you during this time. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      Prescription opiates are also commonly abused throughout the state and in Cincinnati as are alcohol and methamphetamine. Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance. 
      At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      The desire to attempt self-treatment is common among those addicted. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Most of the clinical staff at detox facilities in Washington comprises of recovering addicts and alcoholics themselves. 
      Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression.Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made. This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Aftercare is where you build your character and learn how to make amends for your past mistakes during your addiction.Give us a call; we will have someone help you make a list of detox centers that will fit your needs. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released.

      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.
