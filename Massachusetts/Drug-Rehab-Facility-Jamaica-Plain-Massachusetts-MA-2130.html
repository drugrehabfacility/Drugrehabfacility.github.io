      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      If the person will not help his or herself, it’s up to you. However with some anti-anxiety medications there can be further withdrawal effects and the detox can take longer.  With benzodiazepine detoxification patients are often weaned off these drugs with smaller and smaller doses of them each day until they can stop taking them. 
      Recognizing that some clients may not be able to benefit from beginning treatment while in detox, you’re not required to participate in structured groups or other programming.

      People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      Cravings, obsessive thoughts about drugs, anxiety and insomnia should be corrected after the detoxification. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Detox generally lasts between 5-7 days on average, though sometimes a slightly longer stay may be ideal. While they can not remove all the discomfort associated with withdrawal they can greatly reduce the duration, as well as the severity of the experience.
