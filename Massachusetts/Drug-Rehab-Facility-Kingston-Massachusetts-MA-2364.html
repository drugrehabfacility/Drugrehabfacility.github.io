      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      The centers I work with are unique as the people running them have a deeply held philosophy that happiness is found in living drug-free. These truly expert withdrawal or medical detox program will nourish the body with nutrients, food, physical and holistic attention. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. In some cases, medications might even be used to reduce the cravings people feel for drugs. 
      Every year people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol addiction are getting admitted to achieve one goal in common, i.e. living a healthy drug free life. Medical care to help you remain as comfortable as possible during withdrawal. 
      Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. But, drugs do have different timelines for detox. 
      For all the reasons just mentioned, and more, many people find that travelling for treatment is greatly beneficial to their pursuit of sobriety and a better life.

      With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. Gin isn’t any faster or slower for the body to process than whiskey. 
      This number was an increase from the 4,576 admitted in 2015 (NJDHHS). It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      21% were admitted for alcohol rehab while the remaining for drug rehab. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun.
