      When I don't want to take a bath, don't be mad and don't embarrass me. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Most alcoholics will need at least a few weeks to go through their withdrawal treatment in New Jersey detox centers while others may require longer. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.
