      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. 
      Often detox symptoms exist after this is done but they are less severe or life threatening after the medical protocol is followed to prevent major side effects. Tolerance actually starts to develop the first time someone uses a drug, causing the person to use more and more in order to achieve the same level of high again. 
      Our goal is to help you break your chemical dependency as a safely and as comfortable as possible. Your loved one can go through rapid detox and begin the behavior modifications they need to end drug abuse. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.

      After the detox process, you’ll go through individual and group therapy sessions that help identify and manage the triggers that led to your drug or alcohol abuse, and kept you stuck in it. 
      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. 
      The fact that the physical detox symptoms are blunted during the weaning process is one of the things that makes the medical approach to getting off drugs so effective. Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      Alternative Approaches – Some of our drug detox programs incorporate alternative approaches to help manage withdrawal symptoms.

      Why Detox is Needed Unknown to many street, prescription drugs, and alcohol abuse can cause moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. You may have: Anxiety Delirium tremens (DTs), a life-threatening issue where you feel confused and on edge Depression Hallucinations, where you see or hear things that aren’t there Problems sleeping Shakiness, especially in your hands Unstable changes in blood pressure and heart rate Do I Need a Detox Program? 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. As soon as you stop using, your body and brain trigger cravings and when they don’t get what they want you are attacked with physical and mental symptoms that can be crippling. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.Addiction is a chronic disease that needs to be treated constantly. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. A team of doctors, nurses and technicians monitor your progress round the clock and with the aid of cardiac and video technology in a private room. 
      Whether you choose detox as your ONLY step or you make the decision to overcome the physical challenges of addiction and to then move onto a rehab program that will aid in the psychological side of the disease, our helpline is ready to support you.
