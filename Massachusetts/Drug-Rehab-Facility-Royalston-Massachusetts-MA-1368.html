      People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. You’re more likely to stick with it when you have lots of help.
