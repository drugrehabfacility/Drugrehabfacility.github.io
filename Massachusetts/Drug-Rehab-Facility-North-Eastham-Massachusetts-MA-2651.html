      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. 
      Call 800-483-2193 24/7 to speak with an addiction specialist about detox in Massachusetts. Usually, treatment begins with detox, followed by a stay in inpatient rehab. 
      Aftercare allows you to further your skills you learned during treatment and focuses on relapse prevention and long-term recovery.
