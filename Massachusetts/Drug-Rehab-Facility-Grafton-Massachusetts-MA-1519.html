      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. It gets rid of the toxic chemicals that have built up in your system from drug use. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise.There are even drug detox centers which offer facilities like dual diagnosis, hypnotherapy, relapse treatment etc. 
      You may have: Anxiety Delirium tremens (DTs), a life-threatening issue where you feel confused and on edge Depression Hallucinations, where you see or hear things that aren’t there Problems sleeping Shakiness, especially in your hands Unstable changes in blood pressure and heart rate Do I Need a Detox Program?

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring.Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose.
