      You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. 
      Our medical team, consisting of a medical director and licensed nurses, will monitor the patient 24/7 to ensure that the recovery is proceeding properly. Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      With that in mind, take a minute to spot your individual efforts in acting compared to your addiction. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox.
