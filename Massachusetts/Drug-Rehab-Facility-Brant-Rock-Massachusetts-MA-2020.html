It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. Our specialists will connect you with a detox facility where you'll receive high-quality detox care tailored to your individual needs.
