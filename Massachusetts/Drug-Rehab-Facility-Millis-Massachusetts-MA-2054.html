      For many, this option helps maintains a stronger foundation for aftercare. 
      The opiate medications make the method less difficult; the particular abstinence is simple to follow. It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. There are 12-step programs available which involve group meetings, therapy and assistance with finding sober living and lifelong meetings. 
      This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      We are making you a brand new one that isn’t broken, with pickles!

      Acupuncture – We partner with acupuncturists who draw on traditional Chinese medicine techniques to address pain, insomnia, anxiety, digestive issues and other complaints that may accompany withdrawal and early recovery. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. It’s when you stop drinking and your body gets rid of the alcohol, which leads to withdrawal symptoms. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control.

      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).
