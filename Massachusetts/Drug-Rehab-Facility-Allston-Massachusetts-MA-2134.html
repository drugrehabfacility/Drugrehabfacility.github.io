      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? As addiction’s effects tend to show up in a person’s thinking and behavior, his or her lifestyle changes for the worse over time. 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. However, Illinois has various resources and treatment centers that assist individuals in detox, rehabilitation, aftercare and more. 
      The purpose of this kind of detox program is to slowly wean the individual addict off of their drug of choice. From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction.

      Drug Addiction </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter related to the brain’s reward center that allows us to enjoy feelings of excitement, pleasure and well-being.

      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment? Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective.

      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health.We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.
