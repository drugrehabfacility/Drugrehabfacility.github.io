      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. 
      Are you a parent that can’t leave your family to enter treatment? All of our Massachusetts rehab facilities give you the results you need to live a beautiful life, free from your addiction!Detoxification is an important first step on the road of recovery for an individual addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. 
      And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?

      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.

      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. 
      This makes for a stunning backdrop and a wide variety of outdoor recreational opportunities. The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
