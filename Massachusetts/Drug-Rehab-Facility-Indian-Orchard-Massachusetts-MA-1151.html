      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings.

      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation. There are a plethora of reasons as to why someone would begin using, and just as many as to why addiction occurs, but the important thing to note is that help is always readily available. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.

      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. While many people may think that substance abuse recovery would be difficult here, the entire city is not like the touristy Las Vegas Strip. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage.

Also, there is still a social stigma attached to methadone clinics and this stigma may keep men and women from signing up for treatment.
