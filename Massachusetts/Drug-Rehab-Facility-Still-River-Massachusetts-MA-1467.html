      Depending on the drug being abused, these withdrawal symptoms could include everything from tremors and intense sweating to hallucinations and delusions. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. 
      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. 
      Local charity organizations, such as churches and the Red Cross may also provide free detox treatment help.
