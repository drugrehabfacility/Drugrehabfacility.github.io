      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. With specialized treatment programs for teens and young adults, and supportive environments for adult patients, we provide more than just drug detox facilities. 
      Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. 
      In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. Care is under the supervision of doctors and nurses and monitored 24/7. 
      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life.

      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. 
      Some of these drug rehab centers in Ohio are situated on 10-15 acres of land and offer long-term treatment programs, and some offer programs lasting less than a month.

      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems.
