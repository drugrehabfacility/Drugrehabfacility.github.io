      Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. By the time detox becomes necessary, the body has temporarily forgotten how to produce positive sensations. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals. Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time.
