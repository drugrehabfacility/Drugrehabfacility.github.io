      Research indicates that a significant percentage of clients in addiction treatment programs do not get past the detox stage. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. 
      Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.
