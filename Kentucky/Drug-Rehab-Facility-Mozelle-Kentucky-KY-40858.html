That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. Some of the more common symptoms of withdrawal include anxiety, aches, pains, fatigue, nausea and cold flashes. 
      Following inpatient treatment, many go on to a partial hospitalization program or an intensive outpatient at our outpatient center as well. Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox.
