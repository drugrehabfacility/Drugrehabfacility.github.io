      New Jersey Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics According to the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, 4,705 New Jersey residents were admitted to addiction treatment in 2016. 
      Without drug detox, you’ll find yourself trapped in a vicious cycle where your mind and body craves the source of your addiction until it consumes you. 5 percent of treatment admissions in March of 2013 were for alcohol abuse alone. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. That means people using this method were putting their lives at risk, for no real benefits that researchers could see.In order to recover from a drug addiction issue, people who use drugs must stop doing so, and they must make the same choice each and every day. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. Holistic program options are also available in Ohio. 
      Providing the ideal setting for restoration of mind and body, our facilities and locations provide comfortable, safe environments with extensive support networks for women and men in recovery.Struggling with an Addiction If you are struggling with addiction, it will be one of the hardest challenges you will ever face.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
