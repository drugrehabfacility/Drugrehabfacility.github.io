      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness. Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. 
      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective. 
      Mental health support is often a vital part of medical detox and can help to ensure a person’s personal safety and security. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      For example, methadone withdrawal kicks in 36 to 48 hours after a person’s final dose and peaks after a period of three days, but it takes three weeks to subside completely.

      Generally, for meth, cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs you can detox in a period of 7-10 days. But in recent decades, Ohio’s has shifted from a manufacturing to service economy, causing much unemployment and economic upheaval.
