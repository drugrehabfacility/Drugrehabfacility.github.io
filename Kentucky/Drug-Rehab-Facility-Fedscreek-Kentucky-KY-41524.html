      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. One of the most common drug addictions that Drug Detox Centers Cincinnati area sees is heroin addiction. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      We specialize in recommending excellent Alcohol detox and Benzo detox centers to our callers.
