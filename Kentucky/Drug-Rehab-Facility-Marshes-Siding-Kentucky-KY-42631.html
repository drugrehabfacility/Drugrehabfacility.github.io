      Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Some of the most common drug detox programs focus on providing faith based care, holistic care, natural care and rapid detox. When an addiction problem is at work, the close confines of an inpatient program offers the level of support needed to sustain continued abstinence.

      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      These are often part of larger public or community health agency networks within the government.
