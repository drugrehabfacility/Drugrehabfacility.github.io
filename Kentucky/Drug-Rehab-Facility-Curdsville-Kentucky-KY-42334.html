      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      If you prefer an outpatient program, you may choose to use a medical or non medical program. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      This will allow for an easy transition into treatment without the temptation that can lead to poor choices once again. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      People drink alcohol every day in hopes of drowning out the stress from their life. Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol.
