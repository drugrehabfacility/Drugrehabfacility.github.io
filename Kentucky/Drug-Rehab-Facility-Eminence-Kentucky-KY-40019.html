      Translation to English by Sergio Cadena 14 East Bay Center Substance Abuse Services east-providence,RI 2 years, 3 months Ago Get to know our Emcee for this year's East Bay Center's 2nd Annual Gala Patrick Little of WPRI.com. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. 
      Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used.
