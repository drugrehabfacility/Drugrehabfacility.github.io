      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great.
