      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      As a general guide, the average length of stay is 3-5 days for alcohol detox, 7 days for opiate detox and 7-12 days for benzodiazepine detox. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring. 
      Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts.

      There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. 
      Medical detox centers offer inpatient detoxification services to patients who are already in the treatment facility or who plan on being admitted into treatment following their detoxification. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal. 
      Whatever you need, you can find a treatment option that fits.

      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Detox can take months if you’ve been addicted for a very long time. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. The number of meth lab seizure accidents increased from 364 incidents in 2007 to 395 in 2009. 
      It is solely intended to help the individual physically adjust to living without drugs. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.
