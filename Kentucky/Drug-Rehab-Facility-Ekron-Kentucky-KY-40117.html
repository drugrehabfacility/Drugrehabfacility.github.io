      Most people do nest when they are not bothered by outside influences. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      After thoroughly and safely evaluating a client, detox programs can start to supervise the client during the process of detoxifying their body from dangerous substances. About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland. 
      A combination of therapeutic options is often offered as it gives the client the chance to find what works best for him or her. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process. 
      You can ask about programs in cities across the state, including Chelsea and North Adams. Use our Online Verification Form to check your plan’s coverage. 
      Our addiction councilors are available to take your call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week!
