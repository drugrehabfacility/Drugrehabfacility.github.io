      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. The supervisor (behavioral health tech) Kevin is caring and works hard to make sure all patients are safe and well taken care of. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.

      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      This is the first step of drug and alcohol treatment, and is usually followed by behavioral-based therapy. Drugs and alcohol detox centers provide treatment facilities to those who are suffering from substance abuse like marijuana and cocaine addiction, heroin dependency, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, compulsive disorders, xanax abuse and prescription drug abuse.

      Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option.

Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana.
