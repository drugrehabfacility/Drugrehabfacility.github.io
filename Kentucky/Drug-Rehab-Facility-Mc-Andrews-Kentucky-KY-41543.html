      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. Call us today and take the first step towards recovery. 
      Group therapy provides the addict with a clear picture of the path to a successful drug treatment program. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.

With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.
