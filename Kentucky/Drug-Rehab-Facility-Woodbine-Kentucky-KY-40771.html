      1) Inpatient Hospitalization in Connecticut– An inpatient hospitilzation is a brief stay at an actual hospital. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
