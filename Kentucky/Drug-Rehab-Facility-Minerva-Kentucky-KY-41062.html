      Story of This Life uploaded a new video: Why moms get NOTHING DONE. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. Counseling: Most traditional treatment programs for drug addiction are based on counseling. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      Here, the researchers studied the relapse rates of opiate addicts attempting to recover in an outpatient detox program.

      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      It’s important to remember that relapse creates a question, how is it that you practice encouraging thinking to increase the probabilities of not only deciding to recover, but staying there? Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      If when we talk, I repeat the same thing a thousand times, don't interrupt to say: "You said the same thing a minute ago"... It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis.

      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.
