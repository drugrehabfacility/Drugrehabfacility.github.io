      Treatment Center Finder is here and ready to help you or your loved one. Detox seeks to overcome this problem through expert care and the ongoing support of doctors and nurses. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      Dealing with Withdrawal The long-term abuse of any addictive substance causes the body to develop a dependence. Suboxone, the brand name medication that contains buprenorphine, represents a breakthrough in the medical detox field as the individual receives the drug as a prescription and can take it in the privacy of their own home. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.
