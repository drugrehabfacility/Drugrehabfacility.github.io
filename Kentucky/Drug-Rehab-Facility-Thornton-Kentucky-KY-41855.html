      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox.

      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. Results from a National Survey on Drug Use and Heath study showed that there are nearly 100,000 excessive drug users in MA, with heroin as the most used drug.

      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.
