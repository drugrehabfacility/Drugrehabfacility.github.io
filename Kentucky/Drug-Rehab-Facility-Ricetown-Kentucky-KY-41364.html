      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year.

      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      If you or someone close to you are ready to break away from addiction and establish a recovery, the first stage will be detoxification.A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Call us today to speak with someone who has gone through what you are going through. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another.

      Transition to rehab –Once detox has been successfully completed, patients can turn their attention to their long-term recovery from drugs and/or alcohol, which typically involves transferring to our residential treatment level of care.Please leave us your questions or comments about detox. 
      The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Alcohol detox is often the most difficult process to go through and for long-term alcoholics, the need for ongoing treatment is sometimes necessary. 
      After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great.
