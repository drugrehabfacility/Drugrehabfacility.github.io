      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. 
      An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. Doctors are NOT required at all times - if required, a short hospital assisted detox program is recommended before true recovery begins with effective holistic treatments. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go. 
      Detox Treatment Centers Detox and treatment centers provide a number of different services that are aimed at assisting individuals who are addicted to drugs or alcohol in overcoming both the physical and the emotional dependence that they have on these substances so that they can live drug free.
