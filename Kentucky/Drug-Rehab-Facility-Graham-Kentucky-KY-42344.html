      Arianna promptly ordered her cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, and chocolate milk before Lauren could even take our drink order. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. 
      Most non-medical detoxes will not admit a benzodiazipene, tranquilizer, or heavy alcohol abuser for this reason. Loans: Many treatment centers provide financing, and there are even specialty loan companies specifically for the purpose of funding treatment for individuals. 
      The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center.
