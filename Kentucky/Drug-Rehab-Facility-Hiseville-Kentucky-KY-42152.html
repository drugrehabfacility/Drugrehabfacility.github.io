      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. 
      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. The treatment programs not only help to address the patient’s addiction problem, but also help to address any other problem among the patients. 
      Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP.
