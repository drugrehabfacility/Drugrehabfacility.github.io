      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method.
