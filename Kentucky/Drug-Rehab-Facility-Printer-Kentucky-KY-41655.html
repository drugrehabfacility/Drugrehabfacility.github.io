      Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible.

      However, heroin and other opiates aren’t responsible for the most serious cases of withdrawal.
