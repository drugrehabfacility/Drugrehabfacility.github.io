      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. 
      Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery. Detoxification comes to an end when all of the alcohol has been filtered out of your body and withdrawal symptoms have stopped. 
      There are many people going through what you are right now.
