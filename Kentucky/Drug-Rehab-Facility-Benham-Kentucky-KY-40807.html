      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. 
      By offering residential, day treatment, and outpatient treatment, as well as aftercare programs, they have all your bases covered. Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. 
      Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery.
