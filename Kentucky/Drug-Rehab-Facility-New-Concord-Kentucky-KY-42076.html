      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.
