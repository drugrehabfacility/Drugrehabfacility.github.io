      They often know just how much of specific drugs to take and exactly when to take them. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. 
      Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction.This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat.

      A major factor will be the type of drugs you are using. Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year.
