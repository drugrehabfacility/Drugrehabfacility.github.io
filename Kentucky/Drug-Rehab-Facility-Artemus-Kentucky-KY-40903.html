      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member. Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture.
