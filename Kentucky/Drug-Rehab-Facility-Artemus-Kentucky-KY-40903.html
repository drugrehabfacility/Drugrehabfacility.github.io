      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. 
      Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment.
