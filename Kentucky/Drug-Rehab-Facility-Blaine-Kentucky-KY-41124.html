The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. In addition, the rapid method still came with some discomfort blamed on drug withdrawal.
