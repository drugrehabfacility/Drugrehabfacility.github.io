      Approximately 2,000 adolescents reported nonmedical use of pain relievers in the past year. Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. 
      When leaving a treatment facility and going into recovery, finding activities can be a bit of a challenge.

      These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone. 
      Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. Withdrawals can be excruciating but can be managed and reduced in a medical detox program. 
      Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      Integrative Medical Detox Programs A new and extremely effective detox program may include the uses of holistic therapy, scientific testing and treatment, IV nutritional supplementation, counseling and education.Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
