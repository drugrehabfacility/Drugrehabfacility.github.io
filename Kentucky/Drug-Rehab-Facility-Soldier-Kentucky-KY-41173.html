      Insurance provided through employer-sponsored plans will cover drug addiction treatment in Illinois. 
      Improving Mental Health after Detox Patients that complete detox in a treatment facility are better prepared to handle the process of rehab because they are healthier and physically ready to work on their recovery. They offer spiritual and emotional support to patients to help them recover. 
      It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. It will take hard work and dedication but you can overcome addiction the same way many others have. 
      Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      We can help you develop the skills essential to beating drug addiction.
