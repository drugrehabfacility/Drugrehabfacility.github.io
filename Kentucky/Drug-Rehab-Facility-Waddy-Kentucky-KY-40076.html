      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      A comprehensive drug detox program is the first step toward achieving a #soberlife. So someone who struggles with addiction will likely require inpatient treatment in order to successfully complete the detox stage. 
      There’s a lot that you can learn about success in this area simply by speaking to a friendly professional. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature.
