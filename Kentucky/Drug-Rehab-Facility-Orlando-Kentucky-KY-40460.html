      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Drug addicts in Maryland are not alone, there are treatment centers, drug rehab programs, and alcohol rehab programs that can help them get their life back on track.  In recent years, drug addiction has become a serious problem in Maryland.

Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there.
