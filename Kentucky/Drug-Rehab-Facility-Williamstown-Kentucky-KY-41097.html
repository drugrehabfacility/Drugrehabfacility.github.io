      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      The safest, most comfortable and rapid method of withdrawal will be done with natural, assisted 24 hour care. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).
