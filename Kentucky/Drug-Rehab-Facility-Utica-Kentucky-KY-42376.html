Most addicts are afraid on heroin detox because of the symptoms that they will experience. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. 
      Please call us and we will do our best job to make sure you get the help you need. Drug Rehab Advisor insures when you attend a detox or rehab program you will get the detox withdrawal advice and services you expected. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success.
