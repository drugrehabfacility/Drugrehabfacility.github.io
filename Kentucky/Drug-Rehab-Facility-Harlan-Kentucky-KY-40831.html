      Once your body is cleared from harmful substances, you can begin to address the roots and causes behind your addiction, treating the issue from the source. 
      Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      Amphetamine addiction exerts a tremendous hold over a person’s thinking and behavior. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins. 
      Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you.

      A detox treatment program that is not followed by active rehab means falling back into drug and alcohol use.

      Home-Like Comfort – Far from a stark, hospital-like environment, our drug and alcohol detox facilities are home-like and welcoming. 
      Home Detox Kits People who want to get sober without feeling ill or undergoing a long taper might be tempted to purchase a home detox kit. The symptoms people face during this time are dependent on the drugs they took, but common symptoms include: Nausea Diarrhea Anxiety Fatigue Insomnia Shaking Sweating Chills Running nose Watering eyes Inability concentrate Depression Deep cravings for drugs Choosing Detox People addicted to alcohol or benzodiazepines simply must enroll in a formal treatment program, as their substances are associated with such severe complications during recovery. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed. 
      You will also learn and discuss concepts like humility, gratitude, forgiveness and more.And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses.Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. 
      Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
