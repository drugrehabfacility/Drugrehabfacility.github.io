      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.
