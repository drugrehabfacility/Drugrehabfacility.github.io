      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms.
