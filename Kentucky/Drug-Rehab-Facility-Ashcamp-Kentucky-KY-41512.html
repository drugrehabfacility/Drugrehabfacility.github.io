      Living in joy, true joy, is a gift– remember to cherish it. Our advisors are on call to answer any questions on the costs of detox facilities and addiction treatment programs in Connecticut, CT, including coverage for private healthcare and medical insurance. 
      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. 
      People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      With a 24/7 admissions policy, we’re always ready to help individuals begin the process of recovery.Our Medical Detox Centers Are High Class Facilities Our program is a blend of medical treatment as well as treatment through the use of vitamins, nutrition, and meditation. We can help you determine what option is best for you. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe.

      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem.
