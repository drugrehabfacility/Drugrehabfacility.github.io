When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol.
