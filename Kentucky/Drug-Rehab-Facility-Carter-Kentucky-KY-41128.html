      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. Alcohol detox in Ohio can last as little as three or four days, or up to several weeks for those fighting a severe or long-term addiction.

      But even people addicted to heroin or prescription painkillers might opt for detox, as might people who are addicted to marijuana, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs that are associated with withdrawal discomfort. 
      A physical dependence on amphetamines develops when the body’s system can’t work normally without the drug’s effects. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Alcohol withdrawal is significantly more dangerous, as patients can die if this process is undertaken without proper medical supervision. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs.Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      Depending on the type of drugs you have been using, the amount and length of prolonged use; you may go to the clinic daily or weekly. For most people, withdrawal symptoms have their onset 24 to 48 hours after the last time the individual has used drugs. 
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. 
      They are especially convenient for people in the Cincinnati and northern Kentucky areas.Detox utilizes highly individualized methods so as to cleanse all substances from the body, however there are three general levels that their clients should be aware of.

      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates. 
      These sedating drugs tend to slow the electrical activity in the brain to such a degree that the cells seem to burst into flame when the drugs are removed.
