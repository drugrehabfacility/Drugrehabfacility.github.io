      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Almost all rehabilitation offer twenty four hour medical assistance, and have nurses on-staff twenty four hours a day. New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Be a success story and choose the path to a brighter future.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      There are plenty of people who have been right where you are now.
