      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Specialized detox and rehab professionals give the necessary physical and emotional support. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. Detox may last a week or more, with symptoms hitting their worst within 24-48 hours. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Physical activity shows patients they can cope with stress, boredom, anxiety, anger without using drugs. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program.
