      When this treatment procedure is complete, the client can move on with the rest of their program. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.
