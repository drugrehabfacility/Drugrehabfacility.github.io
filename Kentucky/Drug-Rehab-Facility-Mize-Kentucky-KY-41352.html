      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. Sooner or later your addiction will kill you if you keep feeding it.

      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. We’ll be there to promptly attend to any discomfort or concerns. 
      However, for most people detox is best accomplished on an inpatient basis.
