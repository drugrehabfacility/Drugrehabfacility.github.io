      Choosing a detox treatment program is the first step to a sober life. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. 
      At Additional Recovery Now, clients are placed in a comfortable environment with a team of physicians, nurses, and other staff to assist in breaking the drug dependency. These clients tell me that during their medical detox’s they felt lousy because of the drugs, plus and they STILL have to detox from those drugs after their original detox. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.

      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.

      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. When it comes to making a full recovery and curing addiction you do not want to limit your options, you want a full array of methods that can help and restore your loved one to who they were before addiction took hold their life and they turned into someone else.
