      Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. There are over three hundred drug treatment centers in Maryland.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Maryland. 
      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      When a person abuses drugs or alcohol, the chemicals in the substance interact with the chemicals and nerve cells in the brain, causing certain reactions to occur. Call now to be connected with a compassionate treatment specialist. 
      At Promises, nearly all of our clients complete detox and move forward with their recovery program. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive.

      Are you looking to remove yourself from triggers and other routines before getting clean and sober? Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. They are specialized at treating co-occurring disorders and also offer medically-assisted detoxification and a partial hospitalization program where patients spend 6 hours a day, 6 days a week participating in psychotherapy groups, recreational therapy and educational groups. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction.
