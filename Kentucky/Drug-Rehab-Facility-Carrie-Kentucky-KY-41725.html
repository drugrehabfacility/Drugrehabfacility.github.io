      After long term or short term use or abuse of a drug, when the use or abuse is suddenly stopped withdrawal symptoms will occur. 
      If you know a loved one who is fighting a drug addiction or alcoholism, don’t wait for things to get worse before you get them help. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. Inpatient drug detox is not a cure for addiction, though it can put someone on the right path to recovery and be a strong start for their treatment journey.
