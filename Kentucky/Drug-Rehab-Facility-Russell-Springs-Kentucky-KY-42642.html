      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option. 
      Inpatient medical detox is used frequently for drug detox. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction.

      Addiction is a progressive illness that that does not stop on its own. Since you won’t be faced with drugs or alcohol on a daily basis, and you will be in a facility where your symptoms can be managed under medical directive, you can rest easy knowing that you are in good hands and that you will get through withdrawal safely. 
      A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      The Heroin Detox Centers in Illinois also used opiate drugs in the detoxification process.
