      Drug detox rehab can help you overcome the underlying issues that led to your addiction. Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. However, on a much more basic chemical level, it is all about which chemicals and hormones are released or blocked and in what ways. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol.
