      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      The search for that same high results in a loss of interest in other activities that they used to enjoy. Many detox centers can move individuals seamlessly through this transition.After detox, the real drug addiction treatment begins.

      A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. Dopamine is the body’s way of rewarding itself, making it feel pleasure, causing the person to want to repeat the same behaviors like eating and sleeping. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. 
      These pharmaceutical drugs are designed to blunt the effects of the physical withdrawal symptoms that can make regular detox so difficult. Recovering addicts learn to cope with their issues and develop strategies to avoid substance abuse and handle struggles in healthy ways during treatment. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems.
