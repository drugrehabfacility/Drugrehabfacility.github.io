      These effects can taper off past the first two days, but the process tends to be a gradual one that takes weeks. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. When the best detox withdrawal advice requires medical help for a medical detox, a proper clinic specializing in detox should be chosen. 
      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally. One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being.
