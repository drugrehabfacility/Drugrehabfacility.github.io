      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.

      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
