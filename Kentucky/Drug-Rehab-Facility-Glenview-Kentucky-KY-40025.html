      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.

      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction.
