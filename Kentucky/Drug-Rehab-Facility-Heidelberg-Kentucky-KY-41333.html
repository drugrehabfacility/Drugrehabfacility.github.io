      The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      Maryland Drug & Alcohol Detox Statistics Between 2014 and 2015, Maryland’s rate of fatal drug overdose increased 20. From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts.

      This center specializes in 30-day inpatient programs complete with medical detox, cognitive behavioral therapy, and quality aftercare sober living services. Many people find themselves from hooked on this kind of substances.

      In fact, cleansing the body of drugs and alcohol is often managed at the same time that active therapy begins.Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. Their “at home” technique is designed to help people to recover in their usual surroundings, to prevent relapse and learn how to face triggers. 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. Do not wait until something adverse happens to commit to treatment for addiction. 
      As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do. 
      Important: not all benzo withdrawal requires 24/7 care as drug tapering and individual health of each person is considered. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system.
