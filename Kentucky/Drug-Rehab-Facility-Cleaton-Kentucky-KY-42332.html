      Coming down or withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can be associated with being sick and having painful muscle cramps, uncontrollable anxiety, sleeplessness, seizures, and even death in some rare cases. Many drug detox centers utilize a whole body approach to treatment that includes various forms of traditional and alternative medicine to treat not only the addiction but any other conditions or problems the recovering addict may have. 
      Rest assured that someone will be at your side, riding out the storm with you until the worst has passed. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. 
      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. 
      Also in active addiction, it becomes harder to see that the negative things in your life are directly tied to the drug or alcohol use. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process. 
      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78.
