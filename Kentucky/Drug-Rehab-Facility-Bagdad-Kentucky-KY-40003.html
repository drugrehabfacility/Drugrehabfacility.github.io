      In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. 
      Some outpatient drug detox programs offer to medically treat drug dependency. The addict can then participate in the various forms of counseling offered to those seeking addiction recovery. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Other factors will include your history with the addiction, genes, and the environment you will be going to after rehab. 
      According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use.
