      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. Many people try and fail over and over again to detox and abstain on their own, which puts a great deal of strain on their mind and their body. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. 
      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse.
