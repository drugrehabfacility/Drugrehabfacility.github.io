      In some cases, this involves the use of medications that mimic the abused substance in decreasing doses. 
      For example, according to Bangor Daily News, prison inmates are often pushed into a cold-turkey withdrawal process, as the state of Maine doesn’t provide medical care unless there’s a life-threatening complication in play. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      From 2010 to 2014, 22,000 people aged 12 or older received treatment for drug use disorders in Massachusetts. This means that the withdrawal process for each can involve different withdrawal symptoms.

      That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history.
