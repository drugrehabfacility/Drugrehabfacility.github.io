      Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance. Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program.

      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off).
