      The way drugs bring about the feelings of pleasure that they are known for, the way they create addiction, and the way release from such addiction is achieved, tend to all be hard to fathom for many. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. Family members benefit from receiving social support and educational support through these programs and they also benefit from the outcome of their loved one post drug detox rehab. 
      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors.
