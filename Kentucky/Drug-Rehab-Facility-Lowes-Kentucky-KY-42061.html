      920251 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 9 months Ago Moms work their buns off all day and yet somehow nothing is done at the end of the day...this is why. 
      Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. 
      People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. 
      When those days come, don't feel sad... just be with me, and understand me while I get to the end of my life with love.
