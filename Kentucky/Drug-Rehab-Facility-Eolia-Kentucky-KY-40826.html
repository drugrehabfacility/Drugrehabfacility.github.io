      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. 
      You meet with other addicts, share your stories and struggles, and work the steps, including admit that you’re powerless over your addiction, turn your will and life over to the care of God or a higher power, and make a list of all persons you’ve harmed, and make amends wherever possible. You should get renewed health and vitality as well as medical help.
