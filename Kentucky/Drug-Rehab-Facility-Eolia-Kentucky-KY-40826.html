      The only safe and proven way of dealing and fighting an addiction is going through treatment. Call one of our certified counselors for immediate assistance.

      Stages of Rehab after Detox After a person has rid their body of drugs and alcohol, they have dealt with the physical aspect of being addicted.  However, only detoxing and not following it up with counseling and therapy as part of formal rehabilitation will leave the mental and emotional aspects of addiction intact.  When looking for Miami Lakes drug detox facilities it is also important to find a rehab program to take part in as well.  After detoxification there are a lot of choices when it comes to types of rehab.  The two largest types are inpatient and outpatient programs and the details of each program are suitable for different types of people. 
      This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. 
      Usually, those who choose inpatient detox are struggling with extreme withdrawal symptoms. Prices start at $11,000 for in-patient or residential detox / rehab programs but many average $25,000 per month.
