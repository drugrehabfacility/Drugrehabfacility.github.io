      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. In addition, medications can sometimes be used to soothe the distress people feel during detox. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.
