Keeping You Comfortable During Your Stay At Retreat Premier Addiction Treatment Centers, patients can benefit from a number of custom detox programs that help them resume a healthy lifestyle free from substance abuse. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. Because we entered and completed detox programs, we have been given our lives back and are addiction-free. 
      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures.

      Many common detox side effects include sweating, vomiting, nausea, insomnia, agitation and in some cases seizures. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      No matter how severely addicted you are, we can help your body heal from dependency on chemicals. In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered. 
      There are many approaches to getting off drugs or alcohol, but medical detox has proven to be one of the most effective. Opiate addiction is killing thousands of people every year. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep.
