      State-Funded Rehab Most states provide funding for drug and alcohol rehabilitation services through public mental health or substance abuse treatment centers that can be accessed by those with no insurance or no income. 
      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal. 
      Detoxifying from opioid dependency: Withdrawal from heroin and opioid painkillers can come with very powerful symptoms that begin within six hours of quitting. We can help you get there, once you do you’ll wonder what took you so long to call. 
      And when my old, tired legs don't let me move as quickly as before, give me your hand the same way that I offered mine to you when you first walked. Often, stopping a drug “cold turkey” after long-term use or abuse is not advisable and may even be life-threatening. 
      Medical detox doesn’t replace rehab; instead medically assisted detox + holistic or natural medicine should insure the smoothest and safest transition from a chemically dependent state to a drug-free and sober condition. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      Counseling is a good idea for your full therapeutic of the individual.

      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Suboxone is a medication that inpatient drug detox centers use to help reduce the symptoms of withdrawal because Suboxone tricks the brain into thinking that the person is still using opiates.
