      If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear.
