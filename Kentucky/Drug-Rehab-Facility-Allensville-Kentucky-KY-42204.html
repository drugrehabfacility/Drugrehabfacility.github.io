      Integrative medical detox facilities are a new phenomenon in the medical field. Many people fear that a life without using drugs or alcohol life will be boring.

      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox.
