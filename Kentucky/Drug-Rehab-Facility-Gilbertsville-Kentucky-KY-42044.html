      There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut. I am grateful for this facility and hope anyone in need of detox chooses this place. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.Residential detox programs are generally considered to be more comprehensive, as medical detox provides around-the-clock care, treatment, and supervision. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      The reason that most addicts continue using drugs is because they are dealing with cravings and a mental obsession that makes them want to use all of the time. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox.Our addiction specialists can assess your recovery needs and help you get the addiction treatment that provides the best chance for your long-term recovery.Easy drug detox is a successful method of drug detoxification. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      Often, people adopt unhealthy habits while using that need to be changed when they stop using. 
      We are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can give you or your loved one your best option for treatment.
