      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms. 
      Any medically supervised detox centers in Connecticut are generally ones that have some form of medical supervision, although not to the degree that an inpatient hospital may. When they lose access to these prescription drugs is usually when they turn to cocaine, meth or heroin. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.
