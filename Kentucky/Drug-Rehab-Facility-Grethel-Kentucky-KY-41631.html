      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      There are priority populations in many state rehab centers. This combination approach can be very effective at giving the addict the skills they need to stay off drugs once they leave the residential treatment facility. 
      If you live in Ohio, choosing a local detox center keeps you near supportive friends and family, as well as work and school.

      While there are some things that a large part of these have in common each Alanon group disagrees. The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
