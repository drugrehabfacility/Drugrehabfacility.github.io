      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. Wherever you are in life, there is a facility that can meet and accommodate any of your needs. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.
