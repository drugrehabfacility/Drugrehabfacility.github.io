      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. Sometimes, individuals may need to pay for services up front and then be reimbursed by insurance or by an employer later. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. 
      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible.
