      It means your body has learned to depend on alcohol, and once you take it away, the physical effects can be hard to deal with. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. 
      If so, the state of Illinois has 595 drug and alcohol detox centers. Please leave us your questions or comments about detox.
