      Have you or your loved one ever used more drugs than you intended to? We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. 
      A cocaine or methamphetamine user will also usually not be admitted, however, they may be temporarily referred to a psychiatric facility if there are major psychoses present as a result of the abuse and prescribed anti-psychotic medications. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide.

    <p>
      Any amount of drug abuse can cause someone to get hooked through a chemical dependency to that substance. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. 
      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
