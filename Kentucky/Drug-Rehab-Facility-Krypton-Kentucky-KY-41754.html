      Our rehabilitation centers combine the modern medical treatments with traditional recovery. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      Over 5,500 deaths among residents every year, are directly or indirectly related to Alcohol use and the use of other drugs. One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. 
      We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      The Dangers of Home Detox Someone with an addiction may be under the impression that they can quit on their own terms either because they are addicted to what they consider a milder drug or they believe that their addiction is not very severe. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required.

      It helps patients transition into addiction treatment and minimizes their withdrawal symptoms in order to make them more bearable before they finally end. When the person tries to stop using or they run low on drugs, they begin to feel extremely ill – both mentally and physically. 
      The main problem with detoxing at home is that is not very safe and the majority of the time it is not effective. 
      There are many explanations for why giving up alcohol needs a critical dedication.The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program.
