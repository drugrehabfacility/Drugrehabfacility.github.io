      There are several reasons why therapy is so important during this type of detox treatment and why it helps the program work. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Connecticut go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required. 
      The length of drug detox treatment in Ohio depends on several different factors, such as the addiction type being treated and the detox method being used.
