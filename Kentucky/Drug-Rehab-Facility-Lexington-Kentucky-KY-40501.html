      The timeline of drug detox depends heavily on a number of factors affecting the individual, including which drug(s) the patient abused. 
      Many people quickly choose outpatient rehab or detox thinking it will be more comfortable and less expensive. With rolling green hills to hike and have picnics on and beautiful lakes and rivers for fishing or kayaking, there’s no shortage of awesome outdoor activities to enjoy.  You can have fun living every day for a long, healthy and happy life. 
      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      The first service that they will provide is treating the withdrawal symptoms. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      As a result, any marketplace insurance plan should cover a good portion of your drug treatment costs.
