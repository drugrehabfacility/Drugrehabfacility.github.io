      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      REQUEST A CALL Illinois Drug & Alcohol Detox Detox is the first step to regaining control of your life. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. As you set down the road to recovery do not expect it to be easy. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. The primary prescription pain medications causing these symptoms are OxyContin, Oxycodone, Percocet and Vicoden. 
      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction.

Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. I am happy to be here and I know anyone that comes here will be happy too.Whenever someone enters an addiction treatment program they will also need to complete drug detox. 
      There’s nothing to stop them from taking more, and some people do so. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. 
      As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. 
      That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient.
