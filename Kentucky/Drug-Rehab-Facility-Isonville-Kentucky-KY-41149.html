      Purpose of Rapid Detox The purpose of Rapid Detox is simple, it will help to reduce, minimize, or to eliminate altogether the signs and symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. 
      We certainly do care about aesthetics and making our guests feel comfortable, but your treatment is our utmost priority. This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program. 
      Because the staff is well experienced with managing care so as to avoid extreme withdrawal symptoms, a severe medical emergency is highly unlikely.

      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. 
      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. Their cravings are so intense and impulses are so sporadic that they often don’t even think about how their drug use has negatively affected their lives in recent months or years. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day.
