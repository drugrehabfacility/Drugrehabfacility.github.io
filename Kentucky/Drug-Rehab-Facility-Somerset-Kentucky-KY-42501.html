      Medical detox centers offer inpatient detoxification services to patients who are already in the treatment facility or who plan on being admitted into treatment following their detoxification. In an at-home program, people might not have access to these medications, and they might certainly find it hard to avoid their former drug-using friends and family members. 
      In these treatment facilities the addict will find the same types of counseling offered. Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      Outpatient Detox While the idea of “living” at a drug treatment facility may seem unappealing, someone who’s addicted to amphetamines requires this level of care to successfully complete the detox stage. People who use marijuana or synthetic marijuana will also experience withdrawal symptoms and need to be in a treatment facility to detox. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox.
