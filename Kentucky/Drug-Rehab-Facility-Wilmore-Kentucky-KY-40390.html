Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      The length of stay at an AAROD detox facility is usually 48 hours and the length of stay at a normal opiate detox is 5-10 days depending on the usage. Sadly, less than 2% of those who really need professional treatment will make the call for help. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery.
