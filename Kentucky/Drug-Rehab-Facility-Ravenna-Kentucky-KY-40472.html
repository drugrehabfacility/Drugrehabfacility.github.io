      All care providers should be appropriately licensed and credentialed. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Detox is a procedure that could be applied to many kinds of addictions, including, alcohol, heroin, meth amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, opium, crack, drugs, and many others. The normal means of this kind of heroin detox is simply by permitting anyone to stop using heroin drug. 
      It’s important to seek professional detoxification, simply because it is the closest thing to pain-free withdrawal, because it comes with a far higher likelihood of success than any other method. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment. While this option with inpatient treatment is generally preferable, we understand that dropping everything and entering inpatient care isn’t always a realistic option. 
      Call (866) 578-7471 today and ask to speak to a professional interventionist.

      Statistical information show that in 2004 nearly 51,571 people were admitted for alcohol and drug rehab. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. Although this is not the most pleasant phase, it is extremely important.
