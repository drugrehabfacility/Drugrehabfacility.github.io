      Detoxifying from dependency on stimulants: Withdrawal from stimulants such as cocaine, methamphetamine and Ritalin can come with feelings of depression, agitation and extreme craving. 
      Medical detox is available through high quality drug detox centers under the supervision of medical professionals. Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. 
      The following cities in Connecticut are known to have a detox center. This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. 
      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. With outpatient care, you can still work and fulfill family obligations while pursuing recovery. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness.

      For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.

      Medication Assisted Detox - Drug Detox Centers Medication assisted detox is a common form of drug detox. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. If an individual is able to pay back the amount after treatment, this course may be a way to pay until that reimbursement is possible.
