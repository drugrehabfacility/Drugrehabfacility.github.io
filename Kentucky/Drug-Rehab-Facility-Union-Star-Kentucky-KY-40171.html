      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction. Upon admittance, you will be provided with a personal program plan, often based on your needs in detox. 
      The body is constantly engaged in a balancing act while trying to maintain homeostasis, and long-term drug abuse makes this almost impossible. As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.

      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      This type of detox program means that patients are provided with medication that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms so that the process is much easier. This decreases the chances of relapse and increases the likely hood of a full recovery. 
      You may not know what’s next for you after detox. Basically, it gets to the point where a person’s brain begins to forego basic needs and necessities in favor of the substance.
