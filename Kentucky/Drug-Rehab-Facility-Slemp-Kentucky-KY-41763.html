      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.While glancing over her Patient chart, I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as "Medic...aid"! 
      Exercising improves the performance of the heart and lungs, and activates the brain’s pleasure circuit (the runner’s high). Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths.
