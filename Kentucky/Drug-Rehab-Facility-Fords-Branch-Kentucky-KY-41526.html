      Advocate Addiction Treatment Center, Des Plaines (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today For those who need medical help for a problem with substance abuse, it does not come better than one that is provided by a hospital. 
      California & Alcoholism Consuming large amounts of liquor on the weekends can make having a good time with friends easy. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      No state is immune to drug and alcohol addiction. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. This is where the process of drug detox comes in. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). 
      Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use.

      Complementary Therapies Complementary therapies such as yoga and acupuncture are used to ease pain and relieve withdrawal symptoms. Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. 
      Ohio detox centers use an array of different therapies so you can choose the treatments you feel most comfortable with. The types of detoxes available can vary depending on the method used and the amount of time spent in the treatment center. 
      That’s because we use evidence-based approaches to make detox as gentle and comfortable as possible. Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      When you enter detox, you will be removed from the outside world while you deal with the first phase of treatment.

      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Don’t let your addiction leave you behind in life, or worse, kill you. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. During my examination of her, the patient informed me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer. 
      Medical drugs are given only as needed or requested by the client to move rapidly through detox. The goal of drug detox is minimize and manage drug or alcohol withdrawal symptoms in a medically safe setting. 
      Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. Eventually, with enough substance abuse, the brain adjusts, thinking that having the drug in the body is the new normal. 
      The facility includes a medical detox unit, private residential rooms, dining room, therapy rooms, a library, and several recreational rooms.
