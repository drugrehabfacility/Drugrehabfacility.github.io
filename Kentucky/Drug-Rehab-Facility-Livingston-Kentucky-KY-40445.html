      The main thing that the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts can provide is to give assurance that the person will recover and have a new life. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. That being said, there is one process common to almost every  drug addiction treatment program in the country: drug detoxification. 
      To put it simply, when an individual uses drugs, the substance helps create additional “good feelings” in the body. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      As a result, friends lose friends, families are forced to part ways with their loved ones, and addicts lose hope in ever finding freedom from their addiction. 5% of people who should have enrolled into treatment refused professional help for a substance abuse problem. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
