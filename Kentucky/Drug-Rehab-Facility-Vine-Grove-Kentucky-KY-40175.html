      Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. However, there are often at least one or two medications that can help a patient with their withdrawal symptoms. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.
