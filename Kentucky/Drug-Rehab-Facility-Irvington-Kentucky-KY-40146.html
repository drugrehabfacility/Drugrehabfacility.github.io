      We’d love to talk with you, and at the end of the call, we can even schedule an intake appointment for you, so you can get started right away. There are some carriers of insurance that do not cover treatment for drug addiction in a hospital. 
      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history.

      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice!
