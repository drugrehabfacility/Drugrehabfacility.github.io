      This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. New Jersey is one state that has felt the epidemic especially hard, and people all over the state, in cities like Trenton and Newark, as well as in smaller towns like Merchantville, require help. 
      Healthy habits will be instilled and you will learn tools to help with cravings and avoid relapses. Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Drug detox eliminates physical dependence so that the recovering addict can place their entire focus on the therapy and counseling that is provided to assist in their psychological recovery efforts. 
      There’s no need for you to become one of these statistics.

It is always advisable to inquire about scholarships or grants available for low-income individuals when seeking a treatment center. 
      A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
