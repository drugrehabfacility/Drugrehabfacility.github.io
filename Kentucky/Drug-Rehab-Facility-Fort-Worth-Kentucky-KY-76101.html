Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      They can communicate with other people, tell their own personal stories and connect with others who have been through the same issues in their lives. Detox is in not treatment for the addiction to drugs or alcohol. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach.

      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.

      Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient.
