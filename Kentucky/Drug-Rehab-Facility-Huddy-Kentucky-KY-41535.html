      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. 
      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual.

      For some addictions, natural detox is not wise; however, certain addictions, such as those to marijuana and cocaine, are often treated with a holistic detox model.

      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse.
