      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction.

      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. Making Drug Detox a Success Detox can only be successful when it is followed by intensive treatment to get at the root of the problem. 
      Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. This means, if changes need to be made to the timeline for the good of the patient’s recovery, they will be. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction.
