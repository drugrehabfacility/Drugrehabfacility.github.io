      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      Inpatient Detox Treatment Programs Inpatient hospitalization for detox includes the constant availability of a physician, the presence of a registered nurse, and specialized equipment such as heart monitoring equipment and intravenous infusion pumps. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.
