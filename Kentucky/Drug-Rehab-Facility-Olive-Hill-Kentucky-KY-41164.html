      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. It’s a great start and helps with motivation to continue into rehab by cleaning out your system. 
      Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. Perhaps it could be discussed as a loan that the individual can work to pay back over time. 
      This is where lesser and lesser doses of methadone or Suboxone is given to users until they are completely taken off of them. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.

      Have you or your loved one ever been hospitalized because of drugs? Don’t they know it’s bad for them to do drugs?” The real answer is that no one starts out abusing drugs to become an addict. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years. Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them.

      A lot of factors contribute to the amount of care needed and the length of time needed to administer it. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Since patients don’t have to live at an outpatient treatment facility, they have to assume a certain degree of responsibility in order to maintain continued abstinence from drug use. 
      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone.A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms.
