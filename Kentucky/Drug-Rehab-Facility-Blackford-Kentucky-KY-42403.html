      Recovery Advice When Money Is Scarce Living on a limited income is challenging enough; having to deal with recovery from a drug or alcohol addiction on a limited income is even more so. Never try to detox from alcohol or other drugs without professional medical assistance. 
      It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that "I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me". For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use. 
      Detox then is usually defined by the medical effort to help patients with serious addictions to rid their bodies of a drug before moving on to a rehab program. 21% were admitted for alcohol rehab while the remaining for drug rehab. 
      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance.
