      Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      Careful administration of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help ease the drug detox process as well. 723 accidental overdose deaths were recorded in Connecticut in 2015. 
      If you’re not sure what type of rehab program will best meet your needs, we can help. This allows for you to start at the highest level of care, detox, where you will receive around the clock support and care. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery.

      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. PPO Insurance is often covered out of network and some may cover in network for the detox and rehab programs I recommend. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. Topics you will confront during aftercare should include identifying, avoiding and coping with addiction triggers. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living. An inpatient drug detox facility has a medical staff that will help the person deal with their symptoms of withdrawal, while also ensuring that the person is safe throughout the process. 
      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system.
