      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      These facilities may be outpatient in nature and fill up quickly. Detox clinics are responsible for understanding both the history and the current situation of the addicted person, and to refer patients to additional treatment when necessary. 
      Because of the mental effects of addiction, a person trying to overcome Drug addiction cannot always fully trust their own thought process and judgment. Insurance is NOT required for admission into any of the private pay programs I recommend. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly.
