      A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. 
      These mental health issues, emotional and physical traumas, instances of past domestic or sexual abuse, stresses, or other problems need to be identified and addressed in healthy, productive ways. By putting the same effort in to your recovery that you did into your addiction you can reach addiction recovery. 
      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings.
