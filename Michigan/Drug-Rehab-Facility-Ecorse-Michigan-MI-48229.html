      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. 
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision.
