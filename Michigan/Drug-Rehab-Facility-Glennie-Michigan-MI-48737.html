      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. Patients are given sedation if needed and IV vitamin infusions. 
      Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. 
      Give yourself and your recovery a boost and travel for treatment.
