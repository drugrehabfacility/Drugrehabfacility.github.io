      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Advocate Healthcare’s addiction treatment program uses a medically-based approach to recover, and uses a range of services that are adapted to each individual’s needs. Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015. 
      Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. 
      Detoxification is the first step in a process that is necessary to engage oneself in rehabilitation.

Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      The process can take anywhere from five to seven days.Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.
