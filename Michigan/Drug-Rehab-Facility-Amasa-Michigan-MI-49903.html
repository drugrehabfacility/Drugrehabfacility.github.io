      The best way to deal with an addiction is through treatment, but just like any chronic disease, you have to keep up with the treatment or you run the risk of a relapse. Medications – Our physicians may prescribe research-backed medications as clinically appropriate to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal.

      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. The figures are devastating: Substance abuse costs the nation approximately $600 billion a year. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.

      It’s particularly important for people who are in alcohol detox to get adequate care for a proper length of time because some of the withdrawal symptoms can be quite dangerous. 
      In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox.
