      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high.

Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. 
      It may only be the first step in recovery, but detox is crucial for every person that wants to finally end their substance abuse.At a basic level, detox is a perfectly natural process. 3% of people who need treatment for drug abuse do not get the necessary care. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. People in recovery are always looking for sober ways to have fun.
