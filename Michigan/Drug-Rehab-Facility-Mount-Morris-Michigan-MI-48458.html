      At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. 
      CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive. 
      Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. Sadly, this area has been heavily struck with heroin addiction and battles a constant local fight against the worldwide opioid epidemic. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.

      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      In addition, you will gain a degree of anonymity difficult to obtain if you stay in your hometown.
