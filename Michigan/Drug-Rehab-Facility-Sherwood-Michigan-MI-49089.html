This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      To begin this process and to find these treatment options, a person dealing with drug or alcohol addiction can get in touch with their state or local mental health or substance abuse agency.People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis.

      This counseling period are usually administered by a professional psychologist. 
      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all. In a new setting, it is less complicated to keep distance from of the temptations of addictive behavior. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. Here, they can get the help they need to make the transition smoothly. 
      Our prayers and love go out to everyone affected by the bombing.
