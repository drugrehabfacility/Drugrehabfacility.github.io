      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Keep in mind, drug detox is not designed to be the only treatment one receives when it comes to addiction recovery. C4 Community Counseling Centers, Chicago (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today C4 is a network of community counseling centers that provides aid and therapy for members of the community. 
      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. Drugs distributed into Chicago are intended not only for the resident market but also for states across the country. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 
      Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. 
      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program.

      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. 
      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. Outpatient detox is commonly supplemented by behavioral and psychotherapy. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Many different Christian treatment methods exist ranging from twelve step methods to other faith-centered approaches to treatment.
