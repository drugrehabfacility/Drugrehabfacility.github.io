      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      We know what it takes to safely get you through a smooth withdrawal and on the road to recovery. Many say that admitting that you have a problem is the first step to recovery, and this is true, but only as a mental step. 
      The removal of drug residuals is the key goal in drug detox. There are a number of New Jersey detox centers that provide facilities like inpatient, outpatient, as well as 24 hour nursing care. 
      We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free.

      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body.

      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. Among the drugs to detox off of the most common are prescription drugs in the form of benzodiazepines like Xanax and Valium or opioid painkillers like OxyContin. 
      Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person.
