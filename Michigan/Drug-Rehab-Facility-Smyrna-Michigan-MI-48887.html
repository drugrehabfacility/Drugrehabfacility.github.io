    <p>
      Finding this new way to live is not always easy or on a clearly defined path. 
      Community-based nonprofit organizations and state-run healthcare centers may sponsor drug treatment programs, or at the very least pay a portion of drug treatment costs for non-affiliated programs. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      There are over two hundred and fifty drug treatment centers in Connecticut.  Wether you’re looking for a drug treatment center, or an alcohol treatment center, they are all readily accessible in the state of Connecticut. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      They offer a variety of services, including a detoxification program under the care of physicians. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.

      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.According to the NIAAA, “Patients for whom outpatient detoxification is not appropriate become candidates for inpatient detoxification.” Outpatient detox is more suited for those with fewer difficulties and issues that are either results of or exacerbated by their drug use. 
      Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions. From that point, inpatient rehabilitation has the highest rate of success in breaking the chains of substance abuse. 
      We use massage therapists and nutritionists to help restore you or your loved one to good health.

      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time.

Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.
