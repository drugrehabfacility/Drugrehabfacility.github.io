      Inpatient drug detox at an addiction treatment center is the best way for them to begin a life of recovery while managing any urges to relapse. For this reason, only people at the early stages of drug use should consider outpatient detox. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      The more dopamine that is introduced into the body’s system, the more it begins to adjust, creating a tolerance for the drug. Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances.
