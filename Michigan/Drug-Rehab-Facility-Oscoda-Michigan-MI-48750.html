      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. We respect your privacy and will NEVER share your information.ILLINOIS View the Best Rehabs in Illinois See All Results > Questions? 
      After going through detox, the body begins to feel better, but the cravings are still there, so the mandatory next step is active rehab. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. Withdrawal symptoms can be very painful and the fear of the pain when stopping could be what is in the way of someone seeking treatment. 
      Natural detox programs do not use medications during the detoxification process but rather incorporate methods of exercise, herbal remedies and nutrition to promote a faster and more comfortable detox without adding toxins to the body. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. 
      We can help you determine what your choices are based on the coverage you have through your insurance.
