      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Depending on the drug(s) they’ve been abusing, the symptoms may be different, but they can often be uncomfortable, painful and dangerous. 
      Each person who has to go through the detox facilities in Washington just wants someone who cares while also somehow managing to beat the discomfort of the physical withdrawal from opiates, benzos, alcohol, cocaine and more. Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      A person's age and health condition also plays a role. If you prefer, retreat into the side lounge, or to your own private or semi-private room. 
      Common symptoms include insomnia, nausea, and shaking — all of which can be minimized and treated using medications, daily massage, and exercise therapy.

      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. But sometimes, it’s not a process that people choose willingly. 
      The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months.
