      But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. An interventionist can help identify which intervention method will have the best chance of getting through to your friend or family member.
