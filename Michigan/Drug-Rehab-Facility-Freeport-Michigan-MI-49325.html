As stated previously, no one intends to become addicted, and in fact, there are a myriad of reasons as to why someone would start out using. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. Often when an individual is using prescription pain medications or heroin they are given similar medications in smaller doses to alleviate the physical withdrawal symptoms associated with using these drugs. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. 
      Instead of completing the important step of detox, these individuals find themselves now addicted to a new drug, or even two drugs instead of just one.

      Someone with a chemical dependency can only begin their rehabilitation by first eliminating the substance from their body by abstaining from their usual level of abuse. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Early on in the treatment of addiction, neurofeedback may help you establish healthier patterns of brain activity. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. If you or a loved one needs help with abuse and/or treatment, please call the WhiteSands Treatment at (877) 855-3470. 
      Often the most difficult detox is done drugged up in a hospital according to my clients. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option. In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs.
