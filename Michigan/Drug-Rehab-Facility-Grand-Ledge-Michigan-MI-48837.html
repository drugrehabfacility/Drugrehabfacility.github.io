      Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      IV therapy is important because it allows the doctors and nurses to adjust your medication to meet the withdrawal symptoms. It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free. 
      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      Just as drug detox is important, drug rehab is also important. We can help you find a program that's right for you or a loved one. 
      In addition, it is close enough to civilization that it is easy for friends and family to visit.
