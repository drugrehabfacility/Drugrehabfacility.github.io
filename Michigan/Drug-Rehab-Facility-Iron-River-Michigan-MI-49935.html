      One approach to medical detox as an outpatient is a methadone clinic, which uses medication to help transition you from the drugs you have been using to the drug methadone, or the drug suboxone. 
      These facilities offer various medications, natural remedies, holistic care and other treatment methods to help patients overcome physical dependence and to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms during the difficult phase of detoxification. A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Natural means going “cold turkey” and completely ceasing the use of drugs. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. RDD Center admits patients to our licensed surgical facility for the detoxification procedure to guarantee the proper monitoring and medical care. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      Known as “medically managed withdrawal,” this process must be conducted by professionals in a supervised inpatient or outpatient setting. 
      Someone in need of amphetamine addiction treatment “needs” the drug’s effects to function at work, interact with friends and family and manage daily stress and pressure. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Some drugs require extensive detox periods because you have to slowly wean off—benzos and methadone are specifically troublesome to overcome. But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
      Have you or your loved one ever operated a motor vehicle, or heavy equipment, while under the influence of drugs?
