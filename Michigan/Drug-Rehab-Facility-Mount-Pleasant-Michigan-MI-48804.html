      It’s never too late to enroll into an inpatient rehab program. 
      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. 
      The majority of the Illinois population resides in Cook county the metropolitan area that includes Chicago. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. Medical detox, as this is called, is only the first step in treatment though. 
      Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab.
