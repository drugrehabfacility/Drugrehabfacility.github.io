      Individual Attention The small size of our program, coupled with our high staff-to-client ratio, ensures that each client receives the highest level of individual attention during their alcohol or drug detox treatment. 
      Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. A customized detoxification plan will be created for you by critical care physicians and registered nurses and the plan will be carried out through IV therapy. 
      Finding these centers is often just a matter of talking to the leaders of these faith traditions to connect with the resources. Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. 
      You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. 
      Odds are, if you are reading this you know that your drinking or using has gotten to a point where you might not be in control.
