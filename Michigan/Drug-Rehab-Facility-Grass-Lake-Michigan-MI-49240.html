      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. Some individuals find that being a resident in a detox facility is not right for them and so they choose to detox as an outpatient. 
      If a person has insurance coverage, or demonstrates an ability to pay at least part of their treatment cost, free treatment programs may not be available to that person. Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      During the withdrawal period the person may experience different uncomfortable and painful feeling. Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs. 
      You will detox first, but long-term counseling and therapy is required to secure your recovery status and keep you on the path to sober living.
