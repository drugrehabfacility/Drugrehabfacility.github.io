      Services between different medical detox centers can be very great. That is why our clinical specialists are always on standby, ready to assist you in all that you need. 
      Most detox programs provide for 7-10 days of treatment as the foundation of your recovery but you may require additional time to detox if you struggle with alcohol related disorders such as Delirium Tremens or other serious side effects associated with withdrawal. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Detoxification is just one component of addiction recovery because it rids the body of physical addiction.
