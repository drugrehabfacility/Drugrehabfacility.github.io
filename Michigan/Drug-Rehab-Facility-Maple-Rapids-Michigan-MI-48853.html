      Early on in the treatment of addiction, neurofeedback may help you establish healthier patterns of brain activity. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      Withdrawal symptoms are mild for some, but much more serious for others. A study in The British Journal of Psychiatry demonstrates the value of a formal inpatient detox program quite well.

      Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. For the addicts who have used drugs for an extended period of time the first phase of recovery, detox, can be daunting. 
      It was the first state to establish an ambulance service, erect a traffic light, use police cars, have cash registers, pop tops on pop cans, hot dogs, a professional baseball team and a fire department. Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. 
      It’s important to note that insurance coverage often still requires that the individual provide a co-insurance payment, and some require a deductible be paid before treatment will be free.

      Anyone handling drug addiction or alcoholism should have a life of sobriety and it’s our objective to assist our patients in recovering their life. 
      Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. Drug detox centers in the area see a wide variety of substance abuse problems. 
      The Challenges of Medical Detox While it would seem like medical detoxification is the most attractive choice for everyone, there are a number of issues that may keep people from pursuing this path to recovery. Their detox center offers 24 hour nursing care, and their short-term residential program lasts just 28 days and includes treatments like education, individual counseling, group therapy, art, recreation and 12 step meetings. 
      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free.

      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. It’s also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Massachusetts go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Even though these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

      As an addict continues to abuse alcohol and drugs, the brain produces less dopamine naturally, as it slowly becomes dependent on the alcohol and drugs to provide a temporary feeling of happiness and excitement that would have otherwise been generated naturally.
