      Addiction treatment is essential for anyone trying to recover from alcoholism or drug addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Massachusetts get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. They are scattered through the length and breadth of Illinois. 
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      Furthermore, after discharge from an inpatient detox program, it is important to begin rehab immediately. The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely.
