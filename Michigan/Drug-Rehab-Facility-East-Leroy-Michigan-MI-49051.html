While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Faith-Based Rehab A number of faith-based groups provide drug and alcohol recovery programs. Methadone Detox Centers Addiction to methadone often results from the prescribed use of this drug either to control chronic pain or to control cravings that result from another opiate addiction. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help.
