      You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. Because no two drug addictions or addicts are the same, the need for various specialized drug detox programs can be seen throughout detox centers and treatment facilities. 
      Locating Drug Rehab Centers While seeking substance abuse treatment programs near your home, it’s important that you talk to your doctor for good advice and recommendations on the appropriate program. It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most.

      Many outpatient detox programs recommend daily attendance at 12 step meetings. 
      In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. 
      Therapy can also treat co-occurring mental disorders which are incredibly common in those who abuse and become addicted to drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withdrawal from methadone and suboxone use can be as painful and uncomfortable as the withdrawal of other drugs and sometimes withdrawal symptoms for these replacement therapy drugs lasts considerably longer. Meditation therapy, acupuncture, and vitamin therapy are all holistic approaches to drug detox. 
      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      During detox, we manage the physical changes that occur in the brain and body after repeated alcohol or drug use while providing the highest level of comfort and support. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing.

      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. 
      The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure.But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      If you’ve been addicted a very long time, or if you struggle with other underlying issues, you may require more time in drug detox.
