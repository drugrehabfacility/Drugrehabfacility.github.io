      Group therapy: You and other recovering addicts together meet with a psychologist/psychiatrist. Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center. 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. The use of medications in withdrawal should be to expedite withdrawal, not lengthen it; ie suboxone or methadone use for longer than 1 week is lengthening drug withdrawal. 
      On offer at these facilities are all recovery services, including detox, experimental therapies, dual diagnosis, and transitional living. The process can take anywhere from five to seven days. 
      Medical detox can continue while you go through rehab, stay at a sober living house or even live at home. Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to. 
      Drug addiction is emotionally, psychologically, and physically demanding.
