      Their programs and services reflect their holistic approach to addiction care and seek to address the body, mind and spirit. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. 
      Marijuana was also a commonly abused drug, though alcohol abuse and addiction were also extremely prevalent. Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. You must realize that the alcoholic is desperate to get a quantity of alcohol, and they may lie, cheat and steal to be able to attain that. 
      Getting sober is possible, and we want to help you get there. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Our staff is trained and certified in the AAROD procedures so the client can be assured that their detox will be safe and effective.
