      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. 
      Get Listed in Our Directory Are you a treatment center who specializes in opioid addiction treatment through the use of Buprenorphine or other methods? These clinics use an opiate narcotic known as methadone to move you from the drug you are using such as heroin to another drug called methadone.

With proper medication management, certain people are less likely to encounter complications during detox and therefore, less likely to return to drug use as a result. 
      If you’re a newly addicted individual, chances are you can detox in the normal 7-10 day range which is average for MOST drugs (with the exception of certain prescriptions including benzodiazepines which must be slowly tapered off). The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. There are also opportunities to defray the cost of treatment or to have it covered by another entity. 
      But, drugs do have different timelines for detox.

      During this phase, the toxins that you put in your body through the use of drugs or alcohol will have a change to be cleared out of your system. Inpatient Drug Detox Takes Pressure Off Loved Ones And Allows The Specialists To Take Over For patients with less severe dependency, residential detox may be available solely. 
      Known as one of the leading hospitals in the world, Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, also offers inpatient drug rehab and state-of-the-art treatment for chemical dependencies from alcohol to heroin. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. However, with the right medications, it is possible to mitigate many of the symptoms, such as nausea, fever or anxiety. 
      This means a person is chemically dependent on the drug.
