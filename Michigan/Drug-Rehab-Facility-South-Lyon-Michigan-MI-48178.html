      Illinois has implemented strong plans of action to prevent drug abuse, as well as support its residents in reclaiming their lives from addiction. The schedule is not so hectic that guests are overwhelmed, nor is it so relaxed that it becomes boring. 
      This happens because the brain is adjusting to the increase in dopamine, eventually thinking that the excess is normal. If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. 
      You did not want to become dependent or addicted to benzos or alcohol. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off.
