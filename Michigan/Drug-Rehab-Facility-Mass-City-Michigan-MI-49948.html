      Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. There are many people going through what you are right now. 
      Relapse is a strong possibility for those quitting without the aid of evidence-based drug detox programs. When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.

      Remember, detox from drugs is not a replacement for treatment. Every person who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol has a unique story as to how they got there.  They may have gotten addicted to prescription pain medication after an injury or tried cocaine at a party or started drinking socially and progressed until it was an everyday habit.  However, no matter how someone became an addict or an alcoholic the very first step they’ll take when they decide to stop drinking or using is to go through detoxification. 
      A person can qualify for free detox if he or she doesn’t have coverage under an employer-based plan or doesn’t qualify for Medicaid coverage.

      When an individual is using and abusing drugs his or her whole lifetime is balanced around the receiving, using and finding ways and income to get more.
