      Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Detox isn’t treatment, but it’s the first step to getting better. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      Your local Department of Health & Human Services may offer free detox assistance. 888-424-2626 A professional and courteous consultant will contact you. 
      Their use turns addictive because these circuits are closely connected to ones that deal with memory, learning and inhibition. Though, in a few instances, it’s a vital first step, detox is JUST a first step, and never intended to replace the complete rehabilitation, or rehab, process.
