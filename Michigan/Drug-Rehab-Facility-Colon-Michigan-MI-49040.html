      Outpatient Detox The choice between inpatient vs outpatient detox treatment should be based on the severity of your condition as far as physical dependence vs. addiction goes, according to the New York State Office of Alcoholism & Substance Abuse Services. 
      Ohio drug detox centers provide both outpatients as well as inpatients rehab programs. The types of medical support that a detoxification facility offers includes: Careful monitoring of vital statistics to ensure client safety. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state.
