      A number of rehab centers have specific programs depending on the patient’s age and gender. 
      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. People moving faster tended to relapse, so a slow approach was deemed more effective. 
      This further combines with the higher rates of alcoholism, when compared to other parts of the state; as a result the city has witnessed a tremendous growth of Hartford detox centers. For 10 days, many individuals reside in a hospital based drug or alcohol rehab unit.

      In other words, those people who anticipate pain are likely to be rewarded with the sensations they expected. 
      There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. 
      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine.
