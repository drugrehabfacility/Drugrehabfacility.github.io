It is simply “a ‘procedure’ designed to help an individual tolerate the withdrawal symptoms from opiates with much greater comfort.” “Anesthesia Assisted Opiate Detoxification” is the first step, representing only the beginning of a long process of healing and recovery.

      While private insurance may cover your rehabilitation, some facilities also take payments from government grants that help to pay for the facility you choose.We’re here to help guide you on the path of recovery.
