      Some drug detox centers may also include options for people who are addicted to marijuana or synthetic marijuana. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      All of these medications help minimize the intense withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual in treatment including insomnia, muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and cramps. We recommend specialized benzo and alcohol detox and rehab programs which range from modest to executive levels.
