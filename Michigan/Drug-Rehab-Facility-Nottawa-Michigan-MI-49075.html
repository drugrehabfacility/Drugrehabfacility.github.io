      After detox is complete, treatment continues by addressing the reasons a person developed a substance abuse problem in the first place. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Whichever method you choose, you can find a drug detox facility that is right for you. 
      The dropout rate is between 60 to 95 percent, most likely due to the fact that members cannot meet the expectations of the program. From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences.

      We can help you find a program that’s right for you based on your current condition. Withdrawal can be a dangerous time; depending on the drug of abuse, the symptoms can be severe, sometimes even deadly. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs. A common fear in regard to treatment and addiction is relapsing. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. These include the Christian Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Centers and Harbor Light detox and residential centers, which can be found nationwide, as well as a variety of other rehab centers and organizations dedicated to residential rehabilitation and support based on their specific faith traditions. 
      As your withdrawal symptoms change, the medication is adjusted to ensure that you are comfortable throughout the detox process.
