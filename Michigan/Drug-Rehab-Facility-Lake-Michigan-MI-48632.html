      At Sunrise, we keep things comfortable, so you can focus on your recovery. Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones. 
      Med Detox: Ending heavy alcohol use, certain opioids, heavy use of benzodiazepines or some other meds are better done with medical detox combined with natural medicine and therapies. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients. 
      When a private, self-directed attempt is made, failure, when it occurs, can be kept a secret.

Columbia University says home detox kits don’t contain elements proven to speed the removal of drugs through the body. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. During medical detox, vital signs are closely monitored 24 hours a day. 
      The doctors and nurses responsible for the drug rehab will examine the addict thoroughly and determine the severity of the addiction. Each individual is different and therefore, each person will have their own perceived benefits and reasons for attending a drug detox rehabilitation program. 
      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction. But if you have found yourself needing alcohol just to function during the day, then please call us now. 
      Traveling and getting away from old and familiar people and places may be the best option.

      Detox programs have several ways of treating drug addiction.  Detox programs are prevalent in many cities throughout Maryland; programs such as alcohol detox, heroin detox, and oxycontin detox are quite accessible to people who need them. This is because with either drug, extreme levels of craving are the main symptom to guard against. 
      As the brain attempts to regain an ability to function with either smaller doses of drug or with none at all, it experiences a temporary disruption in hormone and neurotransmitter balance, a condition known as withdrawal. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Once these two phases have been completed, sober living, 12-step meetings, and intensive outpatient programs will help you maintain the progress you have made and continue toward a meaningful life in sobriety.Do you or your loved one ever struggle financially because of drugs? 
      In time, as the changes add up, the brain is primed for the use of drugs, and the damage becomes clear when the addict attempts to get sober and withdrawal takes over. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die.

      It’s touted as a solution for opioid addictions, and it can be tempting to some users, as the whole process is complete within just a few days. Overcoming dependence on these substances can be difficult, as patients may experience severe physical discomfort while the body craves its accustomed level of drug and/or alcohol intake.

      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. The lack of privacy and the potential of mingling with other individuals in recovery is unappealing to those who wish to keep their condition private.
