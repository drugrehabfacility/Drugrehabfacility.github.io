      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      Then, we invite your questions or comments about the detox process at the end. I asked her, “Arianna are you going to eat your cheeseburger?” She calmly said, “No, I don’t want it.” Cheeseburgers, or ‘Krabby Patties’ as we sometimes call them, are her FAVORITE! 
      This is especially true if they are trying to overcome their addiction without first going through the detox process. For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. 
      But that doesn’t mean life is hopeless if you have become addicted to drugs or alcohol. Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      Withdrawal symptoms – These types of symptoms can last a few days for minor cases and can sometimes span out for an entire month depending on the severity of the addiction and the drugs being used.

      Detox gets the addicted drug out of a person’s system and helps to get their brain back to functioning normally. You know what, I’ll have them cook you a new one!” I loved this because rather than just taking it from the table, she actually TOLD Arianna what she was doing. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs. If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
