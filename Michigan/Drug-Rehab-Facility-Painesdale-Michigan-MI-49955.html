      Other drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, take much less time to detox from. 
      The problem is that you are basically trading one drug for another. In Ohio’s high-burden counties, 56 percent of Fentanyl-related deaths tested positive for Cocaine or Heroin in 2014. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight. Counseling accompanies medications to ensure a healthy and happy life to the victim and his or her family. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. 
      These people make a decision to leave drugs behind, and they simply stop taking those drugs on that day, as soon as the decision is made.
