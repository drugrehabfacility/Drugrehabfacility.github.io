      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications. Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. 
      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. Nowadays, detox programs are actually able to remove any drug residue in the addict’s system, and as such are much more effective than simply withdrawing. 
      In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. It is imperative to choose a detox program that can be tailor made to meet an individual's needs. 
      This is not something you can do safely on your own.
