      Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Detox does not rid the body of all toxics that enter it when using drugs or alcohol but merely manages the symptoms of withdrawal. Some are located in hospitals or clinics while others are privately run. 
      The thing about that assumption though, is that it doesn’t take into account that addiction is unique and complex, so complex in fact, that it makes quitting extremely difficult, even for those that want too. Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process. 
      In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction.

      Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM).Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. 
      Once you fix this "culture crisis" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care difficulties will disappear. The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.
