      Just know in your heart that the most important thing for me is to be with you. 
      As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. Others may wish to try to treat themselves because they do not trust that detox centers will ever get to the bottom of their problems. 
      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. It requires hard work but the results are more than worth the effort. 
      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. The discomfort of withdrawal is one of the primary reasons people leave treatment early or put off treatment altogether. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Because many treatment programs are beyond the ability of these individuals or their families to afford, some of them attempt a dangerous cold-turkey or at-home detox, or other treatment methods that are not evidence-based and offered by organizations with questionable qualifications.

      If free treatment is not available, or if an individual doesn’t qualify for free programs or needs a treatment type that is different from those provided for free, there are other ways to obtain funding that may lower or defray the cost: Scholarships: Some organizations offer scholarships to help people on low incomes afford treatment. This is not something you can do safely on your own. 
      To understand the importance of detox, you need to put the treatment into context. An addiction is a chronic disease that not only has to do with a person’s mental health, but also changes the structure of the brain and how it functions on an everyday basis. 
      Each day, they’ll take just a little less, until they’re taking none at all.
