    </h3>
    <p>
      If you are interested in a drug and alcohol detoxification program, it is worthy to take the time to inquire a specific treatment center completely before you make a definite choice. This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. 
      This type of detoxification program is becoming more popular throughout the state of Maryland. 3 percent increase in the rate of fatal drug overdose deaths, pointing to a need for increased access to detox and rehab programs. 
      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. Although there may be at-home detox kits available, the truth is that most of the time they don’t work and in the worst case scenario it can lead to relapse and a deadly overdose. 
      Outpatient Vs Inpatient Many people choose inpatient detox because being under a residential facility they know that doctors, therapists and even nurses are around them just in case they need their service before their scheduled medical treatments and therapies.

      The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals.
