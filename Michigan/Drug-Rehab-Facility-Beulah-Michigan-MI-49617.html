      According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      This is why 24-7 care is a medical necessity in these cases. Cocaine is a type of drug that can lead to addiction much more quickly than most substances because goes directly to the brain stimulating key pleasure centers and users often develop a tolerance right away. 
      It is only a means of getting rid of the physical manifestations and pain that is associated with a steady decline of the substance that is being abused. But overdoing it with drugs can lead to prison or death. 
      12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs.
