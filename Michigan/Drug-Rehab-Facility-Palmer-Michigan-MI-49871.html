      An average of 10 out of 100,000 people overdose and die every year. 
      Red Rock Canyon is a great place to go hiking and climbing or you can head out to Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam for tours and boating. Also, it could be challenging to identify when “social” drinking, turns out to be out of hand, developing into addiction. 
      There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      I am so grateful for all you and your staff did for me - and think about everyone all the time.Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things.

      This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      For example, Valium is used sometimes to ease the withdrawals from barbiturate use.These resources vary from detox centers, to rehab programs, to 12-step meetings. 
      Alcohol can break anyone’s decision making skills, forcing them into dangerous situations where they can seriously hurt, or kill, themselves or others. State-funded programs are more likely to cover the full range of treatment options, though they may not have the most current technology or treatment methods available. 
      Drug detoxification is the first step of all effective rehab and treatment programs. Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. 
      And while rates of illicit drug abuse in Ohio are on par with national averages (about 8% of adults), rates of drug abuse among teens and young adults is higher in Ohio. Jude Retreats is not a 12 step program, nor do we use substitute drugs to help you build a life without drugs.
