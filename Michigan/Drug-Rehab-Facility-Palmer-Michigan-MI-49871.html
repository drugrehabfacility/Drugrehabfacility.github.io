      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      The program aims at guiding patients in examining their habits and changing them for the better. The most common drug addictions are for Cocaine, Heroin and Marijuana.
