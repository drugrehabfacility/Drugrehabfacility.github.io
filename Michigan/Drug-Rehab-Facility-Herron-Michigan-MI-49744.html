      Although many facilities don’t offer reinforcement to follow up after detox, every Detox Centers Service Illinois knows how easy it can be to relapse after detox if the addict doesn’t enter treatment. 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. 
      This is where the process of drug detox comes in. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Detoxification Is Not Rehab Drug detox is so important that many rehab centers will not allow the individual to enter the main portion of the recovery program until after detox is complete. 
      From there, we’ll help you narrow facilities down to one based on your preferences. After detox is completed it is highly recommended that a follow-up treatment plan be in place to handle the issues that are still not handled even though you feel great. 
      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible.
