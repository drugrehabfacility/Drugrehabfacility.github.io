      For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. This is not true, you are worth every bit of work it takes to get sober or clean. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. Inpatient programs have a higher patient retention rate than outpatient ones.
