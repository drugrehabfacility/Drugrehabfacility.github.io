      We’ll do our best to respond to your personally and promptly.Sunrise Detox inpatient detox center is one of the best in the country, safe, effective and dignified. Many drug rehab centers are not run to scientific principles, and simply offer detox, rather than complete treatment. 
      If you are dealing with an addiction, don't wait another day. [...Our Medical Detox Centers Are High Class Facilities Our program is a blend of medical treatment as well as treatment through the use of vitamins, nutrition, and meditation. Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days. 
      Testimonials & Warnings: Most clients I’ve interviewed, even those coming off of high doses of oxy and heroin have preferred drug-free naturally assisted withdrawal procedures. It is highly recommended that you seek treatment in one of our inpatient treatment centers before you go to a detox center. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person.

      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities.
