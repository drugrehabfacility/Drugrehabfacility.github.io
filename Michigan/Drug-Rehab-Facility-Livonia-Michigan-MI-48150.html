      Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      They will then create a plan to help the addict overcome the addiction and wean themselves off drugs. When we got our food I was wondering why Arianna wouldn’t touch her cheeseburger, but was going to town on her french fries. 
      We can help you figure out if that line actually was crossed and what to do about it if it has been. People detoxing from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids all face the potential of fatal withdrawal symptoms and inpatient medical detox can keep them medically stable. 
      The most important thing is that each patient receives the treatment length that is best for their needs. In some cases, a patient can suffer seizures and die. 
      At our inpatient rehab facilities in Lancaster County, PA and Palm Beach, FL, patients can begin the recovery process under the caring guidance of our on-site, full time, trained medical professionals.
