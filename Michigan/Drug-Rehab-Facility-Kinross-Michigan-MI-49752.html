      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. 
      Decide to interact with others in the "living room" around the fireplace, or in front of one of many large, flat screen digital TVs packed with premium programming. During this withdrawal process, the help of experts in a drug detox program can be absolutely vital. 
      The treatment centers offer support for detox / rehabilitation as well as after-care and addiction recovery support. Medically assisted detox is the first step in; it’s not a treatment alone. 
      While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. This is one of the reasons why addiction becomes so complex and difficult to treat. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.

      While detoxing at home is dangerous and unwise, the medical approach works well for many different kinds of substances. Drug detox can also include a wide array of illegal street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine which are classified as stimulants. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. This patient treatment program is most suitable in cases where the patient has no where to go to or in situations where going home will mean returning to the old drug abuse problem. 
      But it isn’t the only method available to people who want to get clean. 115 ALPHA Center camden,SC 2 years, 2 months Ago Wishing our Founder Leslee Unruh a very happy birthday!
