      Our Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Detox Centers help line will help you find an affordable and comfortable detox center. While 12 step programs are plentiful, the success rate is questionable. 
      I could give you numerous examples but they would be too lengthy to mention. Who determines the need for a medical detox before entering an inpatient treatment center? 
      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      Today, New Destiny Treatment Center is a Christian-based 65-bed facility.
