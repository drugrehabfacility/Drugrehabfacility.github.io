      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier. Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Many treatment options and individual caregivers are a part of how inpatient drug detox works to end a person’s dependence on a harmful substance. 
      Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. When you are ready to face your drug addiction head on, Drug Detox Centers Cincinnati will be ready and waiting to give you all of the advice and assistance you need. 
      In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable.
