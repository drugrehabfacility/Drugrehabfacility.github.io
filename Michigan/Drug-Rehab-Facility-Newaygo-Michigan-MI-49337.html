      Need help finding an inpatient drug detox center? 
      Living a Life of Recovery There are millions of people in the world who are struggling with substance use disorders. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. Still more intense, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be deadly and may require “sedation using medication called benzodiazepines until withdrawal is complete” (NLM). 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. This means that all the rehab programs in Ohio provide thorough alcohol detox and drug detoxification treatments as a part of rehab program.

      This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Integrative medicine has bridged over to a truly state of the art process of medical detoxification. 
      Here I am today, happier and stronger than I've ever imagined. In this approach, instead of preventing the worst of the withdrawal symptoms by mimicking the substance and gradually reducing medication, specific withdrawal symptoms are managed with medication, reducing significantly the discomfort of abstinence from the abused substance. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. The challenge with this method is that it’s difficult to tell whether or not the entities provide free treatment without contacting them or your state mental health or substance abuse agency. 
      The latest technology is utilized to assure that the procedure is done effectively and safely.
