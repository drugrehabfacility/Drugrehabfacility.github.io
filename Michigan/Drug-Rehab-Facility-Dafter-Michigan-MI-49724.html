      President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone. Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong. 
      In a study, 646,000 people in Ohio admitted to abusing alcohol regularly. If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. 
      Drugs enter the body, and the body’s systems work to process the chemicals. First and foremost, addiction is a chronic disease that affects a person in physical and mental ways. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. At Mountainside, we make sure that our clients are safe and that their needs — emotional, physical, and psychological — are tended to. 
      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology.
