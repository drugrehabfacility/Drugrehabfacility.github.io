      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. 
      Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. 
      Our counselors are standing by to point you in the right direction. The treatment facilities and rehab programs in Massachusetts drug detox centers are outstanding but at the same time they are quite affordable. 
      So if you have individual health coverage, an employer-based plan or Medicaid, any one of these plans will cover most of your treatment costs. Massachusetts detox centers design each program individually, meaning the amount of time you spend in drug detox will be unique to your situation. 
      It is also better for those with jobs and extensive social support networks. Cocaine abuse and addiction, on the other hand appears to be on the decline. 
      In some cases, withdrawl can put your life at risk.
