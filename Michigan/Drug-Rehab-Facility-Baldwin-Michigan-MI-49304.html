      Life After Detox and Treatment Since relapses are so common, aftercare is a vital aspect of your addiction treatment. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. For mildly physical addictions, outpatient detox centers provide just the right level of monitoring and care while allowing the recovering addict to take some detox measures under their own control. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. In aftercare you learn skills that can mean the difference between failure and success. 
      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths. While taking more of the drug may provide temporary relief, this practice actually makes withdrawal effects worse over time, according to John Hopkins Medicine.
