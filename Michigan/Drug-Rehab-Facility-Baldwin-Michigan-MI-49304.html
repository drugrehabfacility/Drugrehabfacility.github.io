      There are licensed drug and alcohol detox centers in most areas of the United States. 
      Users may begin taking these drugs occasionally at parties but begin to become dependent on them over time to feel any sense of pleasure because it has damaged parts of their brain. If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. 
      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose.

      The benefits of drug detox rehab are not confined to the recovering addict. After you have successfully completed a detox program, it may be useful for you to enroll in a program to help you continue to build a successful life without drug use. 
      Most individuals who attempt detox on their own will fail because they can’t withstand the discomfort or the cravings that force them back into addiction. The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible. 
      This isn’t safe, as mentioned, for people taking some types of drugs. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication.

      Once the need for detox is recognized, it is important to get someone into a facility as soon as possible. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. Detoxifying from opioid dependency: Withdrawal from heroin and opioid painkillers can come with very powerful symptoms that begin within six hours of quitting. 
      It sounds simple enough, but often, it’s that first step on the road to recovery that is so difficult for addicts to complete. Medical Detox with Substitute Medication For people with more serious addictions such as abuse of opiates, it might be a better option to choose medical detox. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services. Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream. 
      If you know someone with a drug or alcohol problem, it is important to get them into a professional rehab center as soon as possible.
