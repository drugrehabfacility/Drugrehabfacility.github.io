      Nobody can tell you you're an addict, you've got to receive it yourself. Our team of licensed, highly-qualified staff use their years of medical experience as well as compassion and support to guide the patient through the process of detox, ensuring that he or she is able to transition from the substance addiction and abuse stage to the recovery stage as comfortably as possible. 
      Prescription drugs and hardcore street drugs are both dangerously addictive. If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Certain factors can further prolong your stay in treatment such as your health, and whether you are focused on your recovery or you are taking a stand back approach in which it “doesn’t really matter.” Generally speaking, alcohol detox is a 7-10 day process with the brunt of the symptoms of withdrawal being overcome during the first 3-5 days.
