      Sadly in 2015, 3,310 Ohioans died from drug overdoses. These facilities provide a faith centered approach to helping the recovering addict to find strength in God and to overcome the physical dependence that they have on drugs or alcohol. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. You don’t have to do it alone though, the drug treatment centers in Connecticut offer various forms of assistance to suit the different levels of addiction addicts may have experienced. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. In short, aftercare consists of outpatient treatment, therapy and support group meetings.

      Their philosophy is that “people recovering from mental illness, substance use, and emotional trauma are able to live, work and thrive in the community” and as such, they seek to provide help with each of these things. Often times, treatment plans need to be reviewed and revised depending on the client’s needs. 
      Our guests are empowered to go on to have a life that is permanently free of drug use. Medical detox is the highest level of care which involves 24-hour monitoring. 
      Back out in the real world, the same activities and environments a person enjoyed before may have contributed to their addiction in the first place, so going back to them probably isn’t wise. Abuse of prescription painkillers is especially high among this group of Ohioans. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it.

      Until you have your life in order, you will not be good for anyone else.

      There are 51 drug detox facilities and more than 150 rehab centers in Connecticut ranging from inpatient 30 day centers to long term and outpatient drug detox.Endless headaches and insomnia are common, as are fear, anxiety and depression. 
      Before you ever enter treatment for an addiction to any substance you MUST acknowledge that the amount of time you will spend in detox and rehab will vary. Legal drugs like alcohol call for a complete abstention rather than moderation which is mostly unsustainable for people with a history of abusing alcohol. 
      Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Depending on the length of an addiction and the drugs involved, detoxification at drug and alcohol detox centers can take anything from a week to a month.Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      Glenbeigh, Niles (800) 506-5834 – Talk To A Drugrehab.org Treatment Specialist Today An affiliate of Cleveland Clinic, Glenbeigh is an alcohol and drug addiction treatment center staffed by licensed independent social workers, physicians, nurses, psychiatrists, certified chemical dependency counselors and clergy. Rapid Detox is not intended to replace a fully comprehensive treatment and recovery program. 
      Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      Over time, the individual takes smaller and smaller doses of the drug until they have completed the detox process.
