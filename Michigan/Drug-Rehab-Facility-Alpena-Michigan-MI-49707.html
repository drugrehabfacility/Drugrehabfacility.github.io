      In most cases, you will feel minimum withdrawal symptoms while in a medical detox. Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. 
      It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.
