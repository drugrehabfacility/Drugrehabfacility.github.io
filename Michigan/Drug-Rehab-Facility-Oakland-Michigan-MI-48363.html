      A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. We have the training, the personnel and the abilities to ensure that you are kept as safe as possible during withdrawal no matter what you are coming off. 
      Non medical programs include group therapy, meditation therapy, vitamin therapy and acupuncture. An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Excellent detox which rejuvenates life is essential to make significant gains in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. 
      As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate.
