      The clinical staff that makes detox facilities in Washington run the way they do are some of the best when it comes to understanding, compassion and helping each client get what they need to have the most effective and comfortable detox imaginable. 
      Rapid detox or AAROD is in no way a treatment for addiction, it just handles the physical manifestations that are associated with withdrawal from opiates. It does not have sympathy for any one race, gender, nation or background. 
      If you live a life of recovery and surround yourself with others in sobriety, you have a great chance of overcoming your disease. These individuals may not know that there are options for them. 
      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. Support to help you remain mentally focused on your recovery. 
      But, most people who live in the state won’t ever have a chance to rub elbows with Hollywood big shots and East Coast elite at the Vineyard. Non-medical detox can be dangerous for anyone with a severe level of addiction. 
      Aftercare is a crucial aspect of recovery, as it includes tools and resources to help the person battle temptation and relapse.
