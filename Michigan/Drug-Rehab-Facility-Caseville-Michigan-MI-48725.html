      The hopeless feeling can be a strong foundation on which recovery can be built. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      Addicts that quit a drug for a short period of time may not be aware that they have significantly lower their tolerance. A professional program will offer each patient the opportunity to work on the many psychological factors that could have been the cause of their substance abuse. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox.
