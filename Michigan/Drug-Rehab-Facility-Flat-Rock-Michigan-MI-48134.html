      Sadly, their chances of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction are much higher. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 12 step programs support the concept that drug use is a disease and that you cannot help the fact that you use drugs. 
      That’s important because everyone has different needs when it comes to treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). As part of being in a supervised detox program, the medical staff will oversee every aspect of a person’s first few days in recovery, including making sure they have a proper diet, fluid intake, and sleep, all are which are important as they begin their recovery.  A residential drug detox program is also the first stage of relapse prevention, stopping an addict or alcoholic from having a relapse early in their recovery. 
      Another option for outpatient drug detox is a nonmedical approach. The medical approach to rehab can be useful for opiate addiction, especially when used in conjunction with pharmaceutical medications designed to lessen the physical pain of withdrawal. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse.

      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. State-based healthcare centers may also offer free detox help. 
      My experience there has truly changed my life and I am happier than ever! It is in fact so daunting to many that it is often enough to keep those struggling with drug abuse, from even attempting a treatment program. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. 
      Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
