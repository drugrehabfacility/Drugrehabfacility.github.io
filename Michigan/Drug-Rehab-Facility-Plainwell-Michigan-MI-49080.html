      Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      About 19,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for drug dependence or abuse in Maryland.

      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. It has also been discovered that detox programs that don’t use alternative drugs are better in terms of long-term-health-effects for the recovering addict.  Despite this, over ninety percent of drug addicts in Maryland go through detox programs which are out-patient programs.  Although these programs offer after-care and support / counseling, they are not as effective as in-house or residential programs.

      The longer these circuits are exposed to drugs, the more deeply they learn to rely on them. 
      Again, this depends upon how long the individual has been abusing drugs and how much of the substance they generally ingested in a given day.And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse. 
      Amphetamine Withdrawal Symptoms – Often the least severe type of withdrawal users of amphetamines like methamphetamine, cocaine and prescriptions like Ritalin and Adderall experience symptoms like excessive sleeping and eating, depression, mood swings, paranoia and anxiety. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol. It’s important to do research ahead of time so you or a loved one know what to expect from rehab.
