      Rapid Detox Versus Traditional Detox Free Detox Centers Some people just can’t afford any type of treatment for their addiction. 
      Because withdrawal symptoms can differ dramatically among individuals, the length of stay in drug detox is not the same for every type of drug or every person. Methadone and suboxone both have the potential for dependency. 
      Because medical or medicated detox is a long-term program, most people complete this type of detox as an outpatient. Patients in an outpatient detox program may also receive vitamins and other medications to ease significant symptoms, such as anxiety so that they physically feel well enough to begin rehab. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary.
