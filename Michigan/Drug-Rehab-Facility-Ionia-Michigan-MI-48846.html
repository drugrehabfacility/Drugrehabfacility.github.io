      Instead, people using this method enroll in programs in which they’re sedated and then provided with medications that can render active drug particles inactive. Studies have shown that prevention programs involving family, school and the media are effective in the prevention of reducing addiction and substance abuse. 
      Some of these may include: Massage Therapy – Massage therapists use specific techniques designed to alleviate the muscle cramps and tension that can accompany withdrawal and allow you to feel calmer and more attentive as you begin the work of recovery.
