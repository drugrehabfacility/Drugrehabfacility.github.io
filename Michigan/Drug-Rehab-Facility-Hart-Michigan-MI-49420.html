      Wherever you decide to get rehabilitation, the first step is making a choice! Outpatient Detox Inpatient vs. outpatient detox are the two primary levels of detox treatment, with inpatient programs offering the most intensive levels of care, according to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration.

      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. SAMHSA maintains a Directory of Single State Agencies (SSA) for Substance Abuse Services to make it easier for people to find out whom to contact. 
      It can be relatively easy for people to stay inpatient for natural detox since it may only last a few days or a week at most. If you’ve developed an addiction problem, noticeable lifestyle changes will have occurred. 
      Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail.

      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. People at the early stages of drug abuse may benefit from outpatient detox provided they’re able to exercise some degree of control over their drug use. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. But perhaps people remain safe during withdrawal simply because most people get help in a formal detox program for addiction. 
      We know that detox can sometimes be an awful process and over the years, we have tried our hardest to make the environment as warm and comforting as possible for each and every one of our guests. Withdrawing from drugs or alcohol can trigger a number of unpleasant symptoms. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated.
