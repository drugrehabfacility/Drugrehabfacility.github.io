      Symptoms of Substance Abuse Withdrawal Withdrawal can present itself in a variety of ways, including sweating, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, and even seizures. In many cases, outpatient programs have worked just as well. 
      This type of drug rehab detox can last months for people who have been abusing opiates for a long time and need to slowly reduce their dose so that they can eventually be drug-free. Addiction Treatment Options young adult treatment programs luxury treatment programs long term treatment programs executive treatment programs 90 day three month addiction treatment program 60 days two months addiction treatment program 28-30 day one month addiction treatment program methadone maintenance clinic Illinois & Drug Abuse The top drug market in Illinois is the Chicago area- one of the nation’s main drug market and a national-level supply center. 
      Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation. 
      Whether because you may feel like being in jail or because you may miss your loved ones, considering an outpatient treatment can heal you without the extra emotional load that inpatient detox may cause. Detox alone will not allow you to recover your normal brain function. 
      Please leave us your questions or comments about detox.
