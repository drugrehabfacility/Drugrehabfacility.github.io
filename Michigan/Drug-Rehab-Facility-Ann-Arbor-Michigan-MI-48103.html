      TREATMENT APPROACHES 1 Assessment Our helpline will ask you some simple questions and help you determine whether a particular detox center is right for you. Drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms Drug detoxification varies depending on the treatment but at Addiction Drug Detox Centers, counseling and therapy are combined to help with the consequences of withdrawal. 
      These facilities are usually part of a hospital or residential treatment setting but may also be found in some rehab centers. A residential rehab accompanied by medically supervised detox and strong aftercare services is the best and most effective way to overcome a substance abuse problem. 
      Free detox centers provide a cost effective method of treatment for those who otherwise would not be able to get the help that they need to recover from addiction to drugs or alcohol. That particular designation is shared between alcohol and benzodiazepines.

      Your loved one will be able to be home and live inside the comfort of their home environment while they spend a few hours at hospital with a therapist or doctor undergoing behavior modifications and detox. After it is complete, the work of unveiling the reasons a person developed an addiction as well as coming up with alternative habits and coping strategies to substance abuse begins. 
      For these men and women, the option of medical detoxification is more attractive. Methamphetamine or meth as it is usually called, is a very strong stimulant that can lead to very painful physical side effects and withdrawal symptoms. 
      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are. AAROD has been used for over 10 years and is now becoming more mainstream for detox procedures. 
      We are ready to help you get started on a drug-free journey.
