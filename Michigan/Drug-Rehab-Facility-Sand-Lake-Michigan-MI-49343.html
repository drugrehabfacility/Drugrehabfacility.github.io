      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      Amphetamine addiction is completely different than a physical dependence on the drug’s effects. However, few of these products really do what manufacturers claim they do. 
      When you’re dependent on drugs or alcohol to survive, any attempt to abruptly quit using the substance can lead to harsh withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to cope with and even difficult to treat. A short stay in detox could last a few days to a week especially for more mild addictions or less problematic withdrawal symptoms. 
      Wether you’re going through a drug rehab program, or an alcohol rehab program, remember that detoxification is a very difficult process, and drug rehabilitation / alcohol rehabilitation is an uphill battle. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      Another study made by New Jersey Department of Substance Abuse shows the number of admissions for cocaine abuse in the year 2008 to be 78.
