      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. 
      Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      Understanding the Chemistry of Addiction Addiction is not a character flaw, nor is it a weakness as some people consider it. Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms. 
      Addicts and alcoholics may be dehydrated and extremely underweight.
