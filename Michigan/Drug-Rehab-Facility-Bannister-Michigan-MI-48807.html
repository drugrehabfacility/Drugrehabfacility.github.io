      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. 
      These integrated detox approaches that far exceed the ‘usual’ medical or ‘traditional 28 day rehab’ solutions. Inpatient detox often involves various treatments for a wide range of substances and an individualized treatment plan for each patient. 
      Our drug addiction specialists are ready to take your call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! Call us today to speak with someone who has gone through what you are going through. 
      Medical detox centers offer inpatient detoxification services to patients who are already in the treatment facility or who plan on being admitted into treatment following their detoxification. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      This is reserved for patients who have the highest level of drugs or alcohol in their systems. You can work together to find a program providing the best treatment for your situation. 
      Many addicts are afflicted by multiple substance addiction (sometimes together with alcohol) and therapy strategies can range a great deal depending which substances (and in what amounts) are found in the addict’s bloodstream.
