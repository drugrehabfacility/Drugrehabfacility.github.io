      They may feel scared about quitting a drug that they have been addicted to for years or are worried about how the withdrawal symptoms will affect them. There are many more services available to people going through drug detox, such as assistance with social services, child care, assistance locating housing, employment counseling, and testing for HIV/AIDS.  There are even detox programs for the disabled. 
      Unfortunately, researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse say this method comes with few or no benefits. Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. 
      You are making the right choice when you seek help at a medical facility that focuses on the detox process and recovery from substance abuse. During this process, medications may be administered by doctors or nurses to manage the severity of the withdrawal symptoms that many people addicted to drugs experience during detox. 
      Therapists have enough experience and knowledge to understand the cause of certain feelings and they can provide meaningful insight and advice to their patients.
