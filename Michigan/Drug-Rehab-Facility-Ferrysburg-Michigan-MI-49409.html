      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided. 
      There are also addiction specific centers as well as outpatient facilities. The time you spend in drug detox can vary based on: Your history of addiction to drugs. 
      At a licensed drug detox facility, the staff members provide an evaluation which can determine what medications are needed and they are always prepared for any possible issues that could arise during detox. But drugs can wreak havoc on those natural systems.
