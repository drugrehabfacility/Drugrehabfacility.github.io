Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option. 
      Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. People don’t leave the grounds, so they can’t run into others who are using, and people may have the opportunity to speak with counselors about their feelings and avoid the low moods that can trigger a relapse. 
      According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 2010, Illinois's most used drug has been heroin followed by marijuana, then cocaine. Medical detoxification alone is not enough to treat addiction. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you.
