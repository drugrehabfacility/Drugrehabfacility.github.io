      Alcoholism is a disease that can be just as deadly as an addiction to drugs. Whether or not an individual has insurance coverage and the type of coverage included also influences cost. 
      I'll cherish and thank you for the gift of time and joy we shared. A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program. 
      Rapid detox, where an individual goes under anesthesia while the drugs are processed from the body, is not accepted in the medical community as a viable or safe option.
