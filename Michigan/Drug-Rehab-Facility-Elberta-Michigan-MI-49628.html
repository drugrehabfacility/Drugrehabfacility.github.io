      Some people wonder what the true need for detox is. 
      Treatment through this program involves conducting visits to a healthcare facility to talk about the negative effects of abusing drugs and how to reduce their use. Often times, people use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons, they use them to get loaded. 
      For example, in a study published in the Cochrane Library, experts suggest that a benzodiazepine withdrawal works best when it lasts for longer than 10 weeks. When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. 
      In cases of low-income and/or no health insurance, most people should be able to qualify for Medicaid coverage.
