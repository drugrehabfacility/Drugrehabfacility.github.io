      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. In addition, there are often medications that are either recommended or required to make the detox medically safe and comfortable. 
      For example, through the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, it is clearly stated that those who are considered to be priorities for state-funded treatment are: Pregnant women addicted to IV drugs Pregnant women with addictions in general Anyone else addicted to IV drugs Women with addictions within one year after giving birth Because of this, if people are in one of these categories, they will be most likely to receive state-funded treatment services in the state of Washington. The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. 
      Many of these programs are free of charge, but not all of them, so individuals should confirm before getting involved.   What Is Included in Free Drug Rehab?
