      For this reason, it’s especially important to ensure the program you choose is best suited to address your particular treatment needs. 
      To many of the people that we help here at our drug detox in Howell, the simplest way to understand drug detox is often is to see it as medical treatment that helps remove the pain and the health risk that the process of quitting drugs comes with. Then we can help you get setup in either an inpatient or outpatient rehab facility. 
      Our therapists will assist you through our world class treatment program and facility, must medical treatment or detoxing be appropriate or needed. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. This “need” only grows stronger with time, driving a person to engage in compulsive drug-using behavior.

      I know...a cheeseburger cut in half literally could make or break our day. Some drugs, like heroin, can cause withdrawal symptoms to begin only twelve hours after the last usage; others take even less time like alcohol which can start to cause symptoms eight hours after the individual stops drinking. 
      One of the problems with this type of detox program is that you are substituting one drug for another. If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control. Long term drug use causes the individual to develop a tolerance. 
      Sometimes a mental illness can lead to addiction, and sometimes addiction can cause a mental illness.

Someone should decide to attend inpatient detox if They are addicted to a drug or are merely dependent on a drug and: Need intense, 24-hour care and surveillance concerning their detox Need to be in a controlled environment while going through detox Are experiencing intense psychological or physical issues as a result of their drug use or detox (IE alcohol abusers, methamphetamine and often other stimulant abusers, etc.) Do not have a strong social support system at home Need to be removed from a potentially dangerous environment while they go through detox If one or more of these reasons apply to you, you should consider attending inpatient drug detox as the start of your treatment. 
      You may get blood work, talk about your health and drinking history, and have tests to check your physical and mental health. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence.
