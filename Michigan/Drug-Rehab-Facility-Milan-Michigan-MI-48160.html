      Our certified addiction councilors understand the ins and outs of addiction, recovery, and maintaining sobriety. Medical monitoring can help ensure that no complications arise from any of the withdrawal symptoms and each patient is properly hydrated, nourished and getting adequate sleep. 
      Our guests learn that they are not diseased and that they can have a life that is permanently free of drugs. This would be for individuals who are at risk for seizure or even death if they are not properly taken off of medications. 
      Heroin is often associated with serious forms of withdrawal, as the flu-like symptoms people experience tend to spark a return to drug use. All outpatient treatment is also supported by drug replacement medication to fight the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms; with the only difference being that medication is administered at home based on the doctor’s prescription. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state. 
      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use.
