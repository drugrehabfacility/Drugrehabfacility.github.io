      The Timeline According to the SIUH, “Most patients can be successfully treated within a three to six day period but the length of stay is determined on an individual basis depending on the substance of abuse, its frequency and the amount, and any concurrent medical or psychiatric issues that may arise.” The timetable can variate depending on the individual and their needs, but treatment should be consistent with what is helping the individual. Ridding the body of dangerous chemicals allows it a chance to heal and repair itself from some of the damage caused by addiction. 
      The Drug and Alcohol Detox Program At our facilities, the detox process begins with a comprehensive physical exam, including a discussion of the patient’s medical history.However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. Whatever type of drug the person is addicted to, they mostly likely have not completely eliminated from their system until they get through all the withdrawal symptoms.

      But this entirely shaped how the rest of our day would go.As soon as a person completes their detox program no matter how long it has lasted, it is important for them to immediately enter a rehab program so that they can address some of the psychological aspects of their addiction that detox cannot eliminate. 
      Psychological care –An onsite psychologist will help patients with mental issues, such as anxiety and depression that may arise during the detox process. Those who are addicted to alcohol, heroin and various prescription medications often find that inpatient detox is necessary to ensure their complete compliance with the program with minimal risk of relapse during this difficult phase of the treatment process. 
      However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it.
