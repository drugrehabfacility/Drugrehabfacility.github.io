      Living Your Recovery Ohio residents are no strangers to drug and alcohol problem. 
      Medications like Suboxone and Naltrexone have shown great success for treating people trying to overcome their addiction. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox. 
      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. For example, an alcoholic undergoing detox may receive Lorazepam for delirium tremens. 
      Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. You will live in a structured environment, engage in therapy sessions, and be provided with food and exercise to help you reclaim your life. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Call 800-483-2193 and speak with an expert about facilities in Rockville, Edgewood, and other regions of the state. 
      All of those who are involved directly with the recovering addict will also benefit from their attendance in a drug detox rehabilitation program.
