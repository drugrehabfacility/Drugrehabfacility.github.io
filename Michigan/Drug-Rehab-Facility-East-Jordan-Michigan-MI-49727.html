      This type of detox is appropriate for heavily drug dependent people, those who have experienced complications during withdrawal previously, or people who have been using drugs or alcohol for a long period of time. 
      The main thing that the Heroin Detox Centers in Massachusetts can provide is to give assurance that the person will recover and have a new life. The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems. 
      After the medical detox, you get admitted to our residential detox program. Recovery Resources has been around since 1965, and has worked to create a more positive image for drug abuse treatment services. 
      Heroin abuse accounts for the majority of treatment admissions into publicly funded programs. We have IV fluids ready to administer and your medical team from our staff will monitor you for as long as you need to undergo detox. 
      The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.
