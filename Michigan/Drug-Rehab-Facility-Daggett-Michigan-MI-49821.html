      Looking into What Addiction Actually Is There are many people out there who don’t know why or how some people would become addicted to drugs. 
      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol. Although the prevailing myth is that marijuana is harmless and not addictive, the reality is that many people need to quit their use of this drug through detox because they cannot function without it. 
      Many people think they can detox at home, but in most cases trying to do so will be ineffective and counterproductive. Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. 
      Both of these medications are opiate narcotics and controlled substances. No matter how far gone you think you are, it is never too far. 
      This is because the patient is placed into a medical induced coma for the duration of the detoxification which typically lasts about 72 hours with medications that are administered through an IV. As unfortunate as it is, relapse does occur, but that doesn’t mean treatment doesn’t work. 
      Other drugs, prescription and street, can result in hallucinations, erratic heart beat and blood pressure, and numerous other symptoms.

      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. 
      It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. In fact, the longer you have been an alcoholic, the longer you will likely remain in detox.

      A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry. 
      A knowledgeable team of nurses and staff is essential to a successful detox program.Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. 
      If a person attends inpatient drug detox, it is usually because their withdrawal symptoms or other issues they are dealing with happen to be severe. At our drug and alcohol detox centers, our team of professionals can minimize the symptoms of withdrawal providing necessary medicinal protocols in a safe environment under constant medical supervision. 
      Those two things are paramount in the decisions you make along with how long treatment is and what is included in any substance recovery program. The guiltiness, indignity and sorrow you feel after a relapse is an emotion you couldn’t measure. 
      Drug Detox Options Depending on your needs, there are many options for drug detox in Massachusetts. Depending on the severity of the substance abuse and the types of drugs or alcohol being abused may also dictate exactly which kind you need.

At the Rutherford Drug Detox Centers, the patient undergoes both the detox process as well as the rehabilitation process without the need of relocation to or from another facility. 
      I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 2 percent of admissions to addiction treatment were for outpatient detox, 0.
