      3 Rehab Therapy and counseling are provided to help you discover the core reasons behind your addiction and how to cope without drugs or alcohol. Addiction affects the brain’s pleasure and reward center, where the chemical dopamine is released. 
      Drug use can cause lasting damage to relationships and careers and it can deplete family and personal finances. You can expect to deal with symptoms such as pain, nausea, chills, sweating profusely, and tremors. 
      Have you or your loved on ever lost a job because of drugs? Most patients report extreme cravings, tremors, abdominal pain and spasms. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. The alcoholic isn't really aware of what is happening in their whole body and is in a whole state of denial. 
      This also gives the addict time to work on the areas of life outside of rehabilitation from drug abuse.
