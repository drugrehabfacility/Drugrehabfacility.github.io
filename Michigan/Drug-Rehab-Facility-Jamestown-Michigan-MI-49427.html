      Withdrawal symptoms differ greatly depending on the type of drug, the length of addiction, the combination of drugs used, the existence of other disorders such as mental illnesses as well as each person’s individual physiology. It is often much safer and more comfortable to detox in a medical setting. 
      Drug withdrawal symptoms can be very uncomfortable, painful and even fatal if not properly addressed medically. Surveys have shown that residential detox programs, alcohol rehab programs, and drug rehab programs can have up to a seventy percent success rate. 
      A clinical staff made up of recovering alcoholics and addicts also helps the clinicians to be more empathizing and compassionate to what each addict and alcoholic is going through while in a detox facility in Washington. Once you admit that there is a problem, detoxification is the next step on the road to recovery. 
      You are not just calling a call center, you are calling someone who cares. This involves both traditional and alternative therapies and can be accomplished through either inpatient or outpatient treatment. 
      As a general rule, the most severe forms of drug abuse require the most intense levels of care, according to Delaware Health and Social Services.
