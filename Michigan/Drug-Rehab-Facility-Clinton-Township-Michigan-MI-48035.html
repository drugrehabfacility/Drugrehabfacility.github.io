      Anyone willing and capable of following my counsel can get well again" The major questions that determine which type of detox withdrawal program a person requires are: How ill are they? 
      Long gone are the days of one-size-fits-all rehab programs. The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. 
      Medical supervision through a natural detox is used to insure safety and address concerns of patients. During the detox stage, withdrawal effects are at their worse, which makes it that much harder to make it through this stage of the recovery process. 
      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. And according to the National Library of Medicine, those going through withdrawal are especially at risk of relapse.
