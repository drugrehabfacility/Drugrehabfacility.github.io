      2 Detox Caring treatment specialists will work with you to keep you comfortable during withdrawal to prepare you for recovery. Outpatient Detox While outpatient detox treatment may seem like the more convenient option, it helps to keep in mind that the freedom of living at home can leave a person wide open for relapse. 
      If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible. Call 800-483-2193 today for help finding safe, effective detox facilities in New Jersey. 
      Faith-based rehabs use their faith traditions as part of their treatment programs. If you are reading this, we understand that you or your loved one is spinning out of control. 
      There are numerous reasons why going it alone simply is not a good option when it comes to dealing with an addiction to drugs or alcohol.

      You can also choose to take advantage of our in-home drug detox programs, which bring the benefits of our facilities to the comfort of your private residence. Some drugs are just so powerful that the body can’t handle a typical cleaning protocol. 
      It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. Medical and psychiatric staff are on hand constantly to provide effective support and will continually check on each patient to make sure that they have everything they need to feel comfortable. 
      The key to accomplishing detox is the realization that the first stages can be the most stressful. In reality, drugs tend to leave a significant amount of damage in their wake, tinkering with specific chemical pathways and altering the chemical makeup of brain cells. 
      Rapid detox centers help patients overcome chemical dependency within three or four days, while others prescribe medications to help patients detox over the course of several weeks or months. Educating yourself is a powerful tool in the battle against addiction. 
      After having used drugs and alcohol for years, addicts generally have a collection of dangerous substances collected within their body, and their tolerance to addictive substances liked drugs and alcohol and alcohol is dangerously high.
