      Recovery is made harder because of this accumulation of drugs, and it could have side effects on the body and the brain. 
      People have a hard time realizing that they need treatment for alcoholism. On your first day in an inpatient detox facility, you will likely undergo many tests and be asked questions about your drug use and abuse in order for your caregivers to decide how best to help you.
