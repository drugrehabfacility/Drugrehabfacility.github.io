      The overstimulation of dopamine in the system cause the person to seek out that high again, creating a cycle of abuse, resulting in addiction.

      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. That’s why experts agree that a medical detox program is the safest choice for people with an addiction history. 
      Treatment can take months for most people and a quick fix is never the right answer for a problem as serious as drug addiction. The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur. 
      Every patient in an inpatient detox program is required to stay at the facility until their withdrawal symptoms have subsided.
