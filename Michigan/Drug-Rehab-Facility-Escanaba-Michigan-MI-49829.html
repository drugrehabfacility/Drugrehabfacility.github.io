      Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. Rehabilitation aims at enabling the affected person to stop abusing the substance of interest, thereby avoiding the negative effects: i.e. financial, social, psychological, physical and even legal effects. 
      5 percent of people in addiction treatment were seeking outpatient detox, 0. This is a process where patients do not undergo the full medical detox but are monitored and administered any necessary medications until the drugs have passed out of the patient’s system. 
      You may find it necessary to go to a facility that strictly deals with the detoxification process or your rehab program may be comprehensive, including a detox stage of treatment that will be followed by counseling on an inpatient basis. Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. The fact is, you are not diseased and you do have a choice not to use drugs.

      An important aspect to understand is that people don’t just decide to become a victim of addiction and drug abuse; it’s something that happens gradually overtime.  Addictions occurs when someone abuses drugs or alcohol and becomes dependent, which significantly damages his or her clinical and functioning abilities. 
      If you enter detoxification for an addiction to drugs, the amount of time that you spend in recovery will vary.It would greatly benefit you to take advantage of the support offered by your state. 
      Take time out to browse the internet or go through a local directory for listings in your area. Free detox treatment options can be used in cases where a person can’t afford or doesn’t have access to health insurance coverage.
