      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.They offer all of the standard rehab options, and have a rigorous and well-structured schedule that makes sure that each person gets the best recovery possible. 
      In the case of long-term alcohol use, withdrawal can include such extreme symptoms as seizures and delirium tremens. The length of time it takes to detox from alcohol depends largely on the individual and their unique history with addiction. 
      Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state.

      Don’t let guilt get the best of you, use it to learn what your triggers are and keep moving forward. 
      Addiction is not limited to a few substances but can actually occur with almost any substance that provides a sense of euphoria or triggers the release of dopamine. Regardless of why the medication is used, methadone is a highly addictive opiate that leads to extreme physical dependence. 
      People undergoing this type of detox are no more likely to stay sober than people who went through a traditional medical detox, but they were more likely to endure life-threatening complications during withdrawal.
