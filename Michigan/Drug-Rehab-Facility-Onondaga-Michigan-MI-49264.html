      Each individual has different treatment needs and so cost varies based on type of treatment program and length of treatment. 
      Stats & Facts Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2015. Someone who needs amphetamine addiction treatment has likely been abusing the drug on a consistent basis. 
      The next step after getting yourself a full drug detox is to enter a program that teaches you to develop healthy habits for coping in life. Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. 
      Inpatient rehab programs are the best route to take, allowing you to make yourself the top priority. Someone who is not aware that they have a co-occurring disorder will not be able to receive the medication they need throughout detox to minimize symptoms of depression or anxiety which in some cases could lead to self-harm or even suicide. 
      Trust us to offer the safest and most comfortable detox process available. Inpatient drug detox works by medical professionals and patients working together to end patients’ dependence on harmful drugs. 
      You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox.
