      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      The idea here is for people to take smaller and smaller doses of the drugs they’re accustomed to, so their bodies can grow accustomed to sobriety in slow and measured steps. At our professional drug detox in Howell, our addiction rehab experts ensure that patients do not relapse, by evaluating them for treatment with methadone, Subutex, Suboxone or Zubsolv among other replacement drugs, and the use of antidepressants and painkillers to help ease discomfort. 
      Therapy helps make a person’s stay in inpatient drug detox easier and more successful, especially if they need to move onto formal addiction treatment afterward. Because of the fact that addiction has so many different aspects that play into it, going without treatment is a surefire way to fail. 
      Many people first going into their detox program feel nervous about what will happen when they are in the facility.

      Detoxification (often known as detox) is a medical procedure that purges addictive substances, cleansing them from the body. 
      Next, you phase down to inpatient rehab, where the intensive therapy is conducted and the most progress made. One of the imperative decisions when you or your loved one chooses between drug abuse rehabs and detox centers in Connecticut, CT is deciding between Outpatient versus Residential Rehab and Detox. 
      Anyone who has successfully finished their rehab program, recovery begins after leaving the treatment facility. Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. 
      There are also other types of programs available that incorporate many modalities to achieving sober success for a lifetime.Outpatient drug detox rehab is the second care option to cure addiction. Drugs – especially opiates such as heroin or  Vicodin – play a cruel joke on the human body. 
      Don’t compare your detox to that of someone else. With rolling green hills to hike and have picnics on and beautiful lakes and rivers for fishing or kayaking, there’s no shortage of awesome outdoor activities to enjoy.  You can have fun living every day for a long, healthy and happy life. 
      Choosing a Type of Rehab after Detox Once you have searched for drug detox facilities near me and found a Miami drug detox, or spoken to someone at Fort Myers White Sands Treatment Center, you will need to choose the type of rehab program that is best for you.  Experts say that no matter how short a time a person has been addicted to drugs or alcohol, they can benefit from a residential, inpatient program.  However, this does not work for everyone.  In cases where a person’s responsibilities in life do not allow them to be away from their family or work, an outpatient program is a great option.
