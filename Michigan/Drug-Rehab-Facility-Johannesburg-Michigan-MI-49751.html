      The greatest contribution that an expert detox center can make to the withdrawal process is to offer supervision. Addiction services provided by the state or through federal funding are open to the public and often offer services at a low cost or free of charge.

      At an inpatient drug detox facility, “your doctor can often diagnose… withdrawal after performing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history and drug use.” This is relevant if you are already experiencing withdrawal, which most people who go into detox are.

Types of Drugs in Detox Most people associate detox with a few more common drugs such as alcohol or opiates but there are detox programs available for every type of drug you can find. 
      It’s an efficient and perfectly natural system that the body uses in order to heal.
