      Alcohol detox programs are also meted out to alcohol addicts in these drug detox centers. Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. 
      If you are looking for a place to get off drugs, you can choose from inpatient facilities where you can stay while you detox, or if you prefer you can select an outpatient facility where you go for a few hours each day or several times a week to get detox treatment.
