      If I occasionally lose track of what we're talking about, give me the time to remember, and if I can't, don't be nervous, impatient or arrogant. Detox is the initial stage in treating addiction. 
      They gradually rise in intensity over a period of three days, and then begin to decrease. 
      Getting through detox may be challenging for most people but once it is over they will feel better, stronger and healthier.About 26,000 people per year (between 2010 and 2014) aged 12 and older received treatment for alcohol dependence or abuse in Maryland.

Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      Clients usually stay for a 9-month residential treatment program. Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms.
