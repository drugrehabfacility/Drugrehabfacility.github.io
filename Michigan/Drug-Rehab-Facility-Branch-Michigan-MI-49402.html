      Choosing A Detox Program Not all detox programs are the same and it is important for someone with an addiction to take the time to find a situation that will make them feel comfortable and safe. 
      Why do some patients attend inpatient detox while others attend outpatient detox? The process begins with an assessment of your physical health and your psychological and social well being. 
      SMART Recovery: Self-Management and Recovery Training is a non-12 step, secular support group, online and face-to-face, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. 
      Heroin addiction or prescription opioid abuse can lead to some very painful withdrawal symptoms so in a lot of cases it is safer to use methadone or suboxone during detox to ease the patient off of drugs.If they end up using the drug again in the same dose that they were accustomed to then the addict will potentially overdose. 
      Another possibility to consider is whether you want medical detox, detox with the help of medication, to remove the chemical toxins from your system that have built up during your drug use; or whether you want to detox holistically, without the use of medication. Tapering People with addictions become experts on how their drugs work and what they can do. 
      Medically-assisted detoxification can also be useful for beating alcoholism and alcohol abuse, and for getting off cocaine, methamphetamine and other physically addictive substances. 
      Rather than using medications or a drug taper to allow the brain to adjust, they stop the abuse all at once, pushing systems into sudden withdrawal.Detox does not have to be the unbearable withdrawal that it is so often associated with. 
      The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. Genetics, trauma and environment can influence whether someone is more prone to becoming addicted, but help is out there. 
      Ultimately, your individual treatment needs will determine which programs will work best for you. Without this process, drug residues can remain in the body and cause cravings for years after drug use has ceased. 
      Call 800-483-2193 today for help finding safe, effective detox facilities in New Jersey. All centers are required by state-law to be wheelchair-accessible.
