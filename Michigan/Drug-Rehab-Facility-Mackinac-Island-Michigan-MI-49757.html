      The safest, most effective method for medical detox is IV therapy. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. During detoxification, an individual must deal with emotional and physical changes the body will endure in the process. 
      The use of drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, heroin, Valium, and vicodin tend to increase the levels of dopamine in the brain. Most people caught in addiction’s vicious grasp do not realize what they’re doing to themselves, or that there’s even a problem. 
      Methadone clinics use the drug methadone, and sometimes suboxone as a substitute for the drug that would usually be used.

      There is usually no plan for detox from methadone and there are studies that show people taking methadone for twenty years or more. As the toxins leave your body, you are likely to suffer pain and discomfort during this challenging time. 
      The downside to this type of treatment is that methadone and suboxone are narcotics and controlled substances and have the potential for physical dependency. Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      Sometimes, as mentioned, drugs are so powerful that people who attempt natural methods put their lives at risk.
