      Alcohol detox symptoms can be as severe as illicit drugs and prescription. In effect, the different levels of care offered work to address different severities of drug abuse and addiction. 
      With methadone treatment, addicted individuals travel daily to a clinic where they receive their carefully measured dosage. The first physical step of recovering is detoxification, which for some, can be a grueling and intense process.

      Most people assume that withdrawal is detox, but they are quite wrong.
