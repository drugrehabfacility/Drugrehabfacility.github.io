      Sadly, for many people addiction is also part of their identity. In cases of physical dependence and physical dependence only, the level of care provided through outpatient detox treatment may be all the support a person needs. 
      Finding Out More A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry suggests that the severity of detox symptoms people feel is directly related to the degree of discomfort they expected to experience. 
      Tapering comes with the risk of relapse, too, as people doing a taper on their own have access to the drugs they’re addicted to.Detox breaks that chemical dependence and gets the brain functioning normally again. 
      Although natural detox may mean experiencing more withdrawal symptoms, the patient will be supervised by medical staff that are there for support and to keep each individual as comfortable as possible. The first order of business is to separate yourself from temptation, trigger factors, and access to drugs. 
      With a medically supervised medicated withdrawal, the symptoms that are associated with detox are alleviated and even in some cases, completely pain-free. It can really work for you if you are in need of extra help, care, or monitoring during this time. 
      If you know a friend or family member whose life is crumbling due to addiction, don’t stand by idly and watch the person spiral out of control.
