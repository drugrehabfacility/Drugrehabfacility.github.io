      Excessive drug use can have a devastating effect on an individual's health and can lead to risky behavior that under different circumstances you would not engage in. 
      While cold-turkey approaches can seem appealing, as they allow people to get sober as soon as they decide to do so, they come with some risks. Addiction treatment is essential for addicts trying to fight their addiction.  In the case of alcoholism, most treatment centers offer help with intervention.  Drug intervention is also offered at some rehab facilities, but is not as common as alcohol intervention.  An intervention is when an addicts family and friends come together and talk to the addict about his / her drug addiction, it is a key part of drug rehab.  Drug abuse can be a scary thing, and many patients in Connecticut get a dual diagnosis, but almost all rehab facilities are equipped to handle any kind of patient, no matter how “gone” they may seem. 
      An individual who has NOT completed drug detox is simply too great a risk for relapse or is still in a fragile enough state that the lessons of drug addiction counseling will not make an impact on them. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober.Our goal is to provide you with a strong foundation of recovery so you can leave our facility with strength, courage and hope that you never have to go back to the way that you used to live. 
      Cold Turkey Some people use a cold-turkey method. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      Medication can also be used to reduce any cravings one may have, especially during withdrawal from alcohol abuse. 
      These symptoms can be either physical or psychological in nature, and vary according to a number of different factors including: How long the individual has been addicted to the drug Whether or not the individual was addicted to more than one drug The amount of drugs that the individual used per day The physiological makeup of the individual Among the most common physical detox withdrawal symptoms are: Achiness (aching joints or extremities) Chills and sweats (the individual feels as if he or she has the flu) Nausea (another flu-like symptoms) Restless leg syndrome Sleeplessness In addition to these physical conditions, there are also a number of psychological withdrawal symptoms associated with detoxification, including: Irritability and mood swings Depression Anxiety Nervousness Why Do These Withdrawal Symptoms Occur?Many different aspects can affect an individual’s withdrawal timeline, including The severity of their alcohol addiction Whether or not they are experiencing or are likely to experience delirium tremens Whether or not they have gone through alcohol withdrawal before Whether or not they are also dealing with drug withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal in general, though, can take a long time to recover from and may require intensive treatment. 
      Those who get treated and then quit going to meetings since they believe they're " cured " almost always return to drinking eventually. Detox centers in Ohio are located in most major cities and many smaller towns, including Akron, Cincinnati, and Cleveland. 
      A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. There are more than two hundred different options for drug detox in New Jersey. 
      The early days of outpatient detox will focus primarily on supporting a person through early withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, headache, nausea or other problems.

      Drug overdose deaths in Ohio increased by 642% from 2000 to 2015 — most of which involved opioids. 
      Although not all recovering addicts will require long term, inpatient therapy, many drug detox rehab programs do incorporate at least 90 days of inpatient therapy into the mix to ensure lasting recovery.Examples of primary benzodiazepine drugs include Valium, Xanax, and Ativan as well as many other sleep, mood control and mind altering substances. 
      These withdrawal systems may include: intense drug cravings, profuse sweating, severe muscle and bone aches, nausea and vomiting, feeling of heaviness, intense muscle cramping, depression, cold sweats, chills, diarrhea, and fever. Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. 
      This is especially the case when addiction has developed.
