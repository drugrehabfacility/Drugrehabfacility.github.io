      Choosing natural detox also usually means that you will be staying inpatient in a facility throughout the course of the program. Follow-up programs are vital to the recovery process.

      However, an outpatient detox service is preferable when emotions play an important role in the way you use those substances that are now killing you. Patients may also experience cravings for the drug and other psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, paranoia or even hallucinations.
