      Expect highly talented doctors and individuals working at the integrated holistic treatment centers I recommend. Physical dependency is an important part of addiction but for most addicts, their mental health is what keeps them coming back to drugs as a solution for their problems. 
      The exact process for weaning the person off drugs will depend on the substance or substance they are using. A sudden drop in alcohol or some drugs can cause serious issues, such as seizures. 
      Therapy will be a necessity in the treatment of those in inpatient detox because they are usually dealing with more intense issues than their withdrawal symptoms. According to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, supports commonly used include: Medical treatment One-on-one counseling Group counseling Support group work While not everyone may feel they need formal treatment help, not making it through the detox stage only works to strengthen the hold amphetamines have over a person’s life. 
      The toxins, that have so far poisoned the body, are released.

From holistic centers that focus on a healthy body, mind, and spirit; to faith-based and gender based treatment centers. 
      During this time, when withdrawal symptoms are most severe, comfort and compassion are paramount. Club drugs can include hallucinogens like LSD or drugs causing euphoria like Ecstasy, Ketamine and PCP. 
      Sadly, however, this does not render it immune to the effects of substance abuse.

A medical detox is a medication assisted withdrawal protocol designed to specifically assist and stem the seemingly overwhelming pain and medical problems that are associated with the sudden decline of intake of the substance in question. 
      If you or someone you care about is suffering from a substance abuse problem or a drug addiction, it is important to get them into a quality medical detox program as soon as possible. Most people use drugs as a way of self-medicating when they are not able to rid themselves of difficult emotions.

      A formal detox program help alleviate uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and ease cravings. 
      IV therapy allows doctors to adjust the medication used during the detox process as your withdrawal symptoms change and it also allows them to keep you comfortable. I contend that our nation's "health care crisis" is not the result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses. 
      A long term detox could last a few weeks to possibly months if it is an outpatient program. Staff members will make sure you are well cared for, provided with nourishment, and supervision to ease your suffering. 
      We want to help you find the treatment facility that will give you the best probability of a long-lasting recovery.
