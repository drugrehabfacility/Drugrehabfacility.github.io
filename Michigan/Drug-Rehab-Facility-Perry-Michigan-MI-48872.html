      In Ohio, over 267,000 people abuse illicit street drugs. We certainly do care about aesthetics and making our guests feel comfortable, but your treatment is our utmost priority. 
      While this sounds great in theory, suddenly stopping drug use can actually have serious consequences and can even be life threatening. My first interest is to get you or a loved one well again. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. If you or your loved one can answer yes to any of these questions, then drug detox is right for you. 
      Benefits of a Detox Program When you choose to enter an inpatient detox program, you will find yourself in a safe, comfortable environment.
