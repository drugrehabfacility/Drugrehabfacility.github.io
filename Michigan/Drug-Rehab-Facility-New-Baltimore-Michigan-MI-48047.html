      This support system of friends and work will be the strength of the addict when they are prepared to live a life of rehabilitation on their own. 
      Although detoxing at home is technically possible, it is not a very wise choice for a number of different reasons. During detox, your body will go through withdrawal symptoms as you are cut off from drugs or alcohol.

      Detoxing without medication and monitoring can be dangerous, especially if you have been using alcohol or benzodiazepines.

      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. Someone who’s addicted “needs” amphetamine effects to face daily life responsibilities, while a physical dependence is only physical in nature. 
      If a medical problem comes up, someone detoxing at home does not have the training or education to recognize a complication and they could be in an unsafe situation without any help. The problem with drug use is that it usually intensifies these issues by causing mood swings and more severe ups and downs that can wreak havoc on a person’s mental health. 
      The problem with detox kits or attempting detox alone is that the person may not be aware of underlying mental health issues, medical problems or complications as they occur.
