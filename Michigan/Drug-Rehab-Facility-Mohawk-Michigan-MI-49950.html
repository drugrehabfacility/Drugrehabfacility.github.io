      Attending a drug rehabilitation program is the next step in recovering from addiction. 
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. Other drugs, like stimulants, may cause a need for powerful medications like neuroleptics if the individual is undergoing intense psychosis as a result of ending their abuse of these drugs (CHCE). 
      Most rehabs also offer group therapy which can be a very healing experience for most people after completing detox. Church Support: Many addicts in recovery find church support groups to be more beneficial than AA or NA. 
      From dual diagnosis for treatment of underlying mental disorders to psychological counseling and therapy, it can take years of in-depth treatment to truly get to the bottom of an addiction. A patient stays at the facility which is incredibly important as they need the extra boundaries and structure to better recover from drug dependence. 
      Detox facilities are often licensed by the department of health in a particular state, city, or county. However, when you select an outpatient detox you are not in the place where your health care provider is, unless you go to visit, but still you receive the attention that you need at the time you need it. 
      While natural detox centers provide excellent holistic care, sometimes direct medical attention is required.
