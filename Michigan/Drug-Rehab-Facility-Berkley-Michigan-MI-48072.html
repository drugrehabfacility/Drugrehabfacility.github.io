      It can be difficult to change your habits and lifestyle when surrounded by the same people you used with. A path for the new life will help them continue a sober lifestyle. 
      For example, according to Medline Plus, opiate addictions are often treated with methadone or buprenorphine, which help relieve some of the discomfort the addicted individual experiences during detox. Vital signs are frequently taken and patients have various lab tests,electrocardiogram and other examinations. 
      This approach allows you to stay as a resident for a specific amount of time while the drugs are removed from your system. People can also detox from recreational club drugs which can be highly addictive and cause serious physical and mental damage to users. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous.
