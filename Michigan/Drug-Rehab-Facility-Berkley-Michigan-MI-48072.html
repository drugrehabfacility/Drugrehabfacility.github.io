      Every year, continued research into drug detox and rehabilitation methods is helping more and more drug addicts deal with their addiction. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the cost of substance abuse continues to mount. 
      As of 2011, over 22 million teens over age 12 abused illicit drugs. As purity of the drug has risen over the past decade so too have overdose related deaths. 
      A potent illegal narcotic (opiate) drug, heroin abuse is on the rise statewide and drug detox centers as well as law enforcement officials have seen a major increase in addiction and overdose rates in the Cincinnati area as well as elsewhere in the state, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Detox can be provided for a wide range of drugs and can differ greatly depending on the individual’s level of abuse and physiology. 
      Compassionate, trained professionals will monitor you and assist you in any way possible while your body fights the toxins that have accumulated due to drug abuse.
