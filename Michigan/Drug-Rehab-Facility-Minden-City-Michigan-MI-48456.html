      Methadone clinics and maintenance centers are funded by state and federal agencies and there are no safety measures in place to have clients stop taking the drugs. A Common Myth About Detox Sadly, there are a number of  false promises floating around the addiction treatment industry.

Over-the-counter medications are often surprisingly helpful in amending gastrointestinal distress, but sometimes, people find that prescription medications can help them to sleep better and feel better overall. 
      Detoxification is most effective when it is medically managed because it can be associated with a number of withdrawal symptoms that are not only unpleasant but can also be quite dangerous. Changes to watch for include: Work/school problems Depression Money problems Relationship problems Inpatient vs.

      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Without drug rehab, the chance of an individual relapsing and using drugs again is very high just like it is if the individual does not complete drug detox.

      Sadly, despite the pristine coastline that spans quaint Connecticut, a major problem is on the horizon—opioid addiction and a rise in heroin-related overdose deaths.Therapy can help them work through those issues in a way that medication cannot do.
