Most drug and alcohol rehab centers do not have an inpatient detox treatment program center on-site but work closely with inpatient detox facilities to help make the transition between detox and rehab seamless. 
      The best rehab centers in Ohio stress on both mental and physical well-being. Their three-fold mission is to advance prevention, recovery, and wellness through healthy lifestyles for individuals, families, and the whole community. 
      To them, everyone should already know the dangers of drugs and that, if you use them, you are a character of low morality and willpower whose principles need a lot of work. Part of this aftercare can include fellowship meetings, gatherings with other alumni of their treatment program, sober living, and supportive friendships, many of which may have formed in treatment. 
      But be mindful that the same triggers that caused their habit is nevertheless there along with access to those substances are available and within their reach.
