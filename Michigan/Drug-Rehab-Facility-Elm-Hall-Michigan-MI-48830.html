      Rather, it is the result of a "crisis of culture", a culture in which it is perfectly acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. Medical detox essentially means that you are provided with a replacement medication as you wean yourself off of opiates and this type of program typically will take much longer than natural detox. 
      Patients simply come in periodically to receive their medication and check in with doctors to evaluate their progress. The individuals who are given drugs like buprenorphine and methadone are usually weaned off of them slowly, as are individuals who are dependent on CNS depressants and many other types of prescription drugs. 
      The people there realize that often one or more of these problems come hand in hand, and so they are well equipped to deal with them. For instance, the symptoms associated with stimulant withdrawal generally progress a lot faster than those associated with opioid use, so a heroin user will likely need more time in detox than a cocaine user. 
      The course of treatment may include an initial round of detox, in which the addict is weaned off the drug slowly and kept as comfortable as possible.
