      Substance abuse causes an overstimulation of the brain’s pleasure centers, which causes the “high” that people refer to when using drugs. 
      We specialise in helping you find inpatient and outpatient detoxification centers in Connecticut, CT with treatment programs for substance abuse. 4 Recovery Follow-up programs and continued attention to recovery assist you in maintaining a sober lifestyle following the treatment received in detox and rehab. 
      If quitting were easy, then everyone who ever wanted to stop abusing drugs or alcohol would be sober. This is where patients learn to live without drugs or alcohol. 
      Try to remember the times when you were little and I would read the same story night after night until you would fall asleep. Some drugs are just too dangerous to stop taking all at once, and some drugs cause huge withdrawal cravings that are very hard to ignore. 
      Studies reveal that there are cases where individuals have been taking methadone for over 20 years.

      Some Connecticut detox centers tout “rapid detox” but these are not recommended as they do not provide the body adequate time to release the drugs and to recover from the harsh side effects of withdrawal. Without continued treatment after detox most patients will end up relapsing because they have not been trained to cope effectively with their mental addiction. 
      They provide support sessions and counseling on one to one basis instead of a group. You should have the actual desire to be back to the strong person you know you deserve to be, and all you have to do is get over this ugly step and there will be such an amazing future for you, something you can’t even imagine.
