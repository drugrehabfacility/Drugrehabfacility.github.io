    <p>
      It is only possible to recover from an addiction once you have completed the very necessary first step of going through detox. We have over 20 years in the business of helping fellow addicts and alcoholics to recover from the torments of their addictions and we are fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations- the Gold standard in Health Care Quality Assurance. 
      A detox from drugs or alcohol is needed once it is determined that the safety and well-being of the client is in question. Detox allows people to feel a little more freedom from the prison that their addiction had become. 
      When relapse occurs, you will create your restrictions and learn from your slip-ups so you don’t have to go through a relapse again. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      The benefit of natural detox is that you can quit using your drug of choice right away and you are usually able to complete the detox program within a few days to a week.
