      As soon as a person enters detox their withdrawal symptoms can start within the first 24 hours of abstaining from drug use. You may also receive outpatient hospitalization in case of emergency, but without the overnight stay cost of inpatient detox. 
      Planned with a lot of care and  support, a properly conducted intervention can be the difference between life and death for someone who is addicted. When the process is made pain-free, most patients are far more likely to stay through the process, and emerge drug-free. 
      Before a center is recommended, a transparent assessment and disclosure of service and outcome expectations is given. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      Your career, relationships, and health are at risk of being destroyed. That often includes medicine to help ease symptoms as well as care for medical and mental health conditions. 
      Before leaving the facility, an aftercare plan should be developed to help the clients stay in a treatment mindset as they venture back into a world full of temptation.
