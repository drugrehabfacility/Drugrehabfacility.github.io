      The important thing to keep in mind is that as long as you are supervised by medical professionals, your detox will be safe and healthy. Roughly 80% of individuals who enter detox programs, followed by rehab, will be freed from addiction. 
      With medical detox (used most commonly with opiate addiction to heroin, Vicodin or OxyContin), the individual takes regular doses of a synthetic opiate. For those who do not have any method of paying for the treatment provided by a detox center, there is no reason to lose hope. 
      This is why professional treatment is so necessary. CBT – an evidence-based, time-limited psychotherapy – can help you identify and treat the degree of co-morbid disorders, such as mental illness and addiction, if that is the case. 
      There are priority populations in many state rehab centers.
