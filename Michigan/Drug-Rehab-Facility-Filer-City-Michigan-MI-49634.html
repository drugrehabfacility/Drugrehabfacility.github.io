      The term detoxification covers all aspects of the individual's withdrawal and purification from drugs. 
      However, some people need additional time because their case is more complicated. Illinois detox centers provide access to the care necessary to manage symptoms of withdrawal in a safe, clean environment. 
      Each part of recovery is essential to a full treatment program and without detox, patients would not have the foundation they need to be healthy and sober. Let us help find a program that suits your needs. 
      Alcohol, benzodiazipenes are almost usually recommended to be medically supervised, whether within a medically supervised detox or a more monitored inpatient hospital stay. Patients stay in an inpatient detox program for as little as two days, and as many as ten, depending on their general physical state. 
      Once an individual is ‘clean’ of opiates, it is always recommended they make some form of counseling their next step in the recovery process. You get to see, for example, that while detox has important role to play in the taming of an addiction, it is but one step of an involved process that often takes many years. 
      That is why attending therapy sessions throughout rehab is an important part of the process.
