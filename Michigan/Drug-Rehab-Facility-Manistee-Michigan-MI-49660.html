    <p>
      For patients addicted to less severe drugs or with mild addictions, they might choose natural detox as a way to simply go “cold turkey” but under medical supervision. There are programs for people with private insurance and self paying capabilities. 
      Some people may choose a home detox but the painful withdrawal symptoms can lead to relapse. Remember though, that relapse doesn’t mean that someone is a failure or has lower morals. 
      Why Residential Treatment is Recommended Most No matter what the nature of the addiction or its duration, residential drug treatment is often the best option for getting clean and staying off drugs for the long term. Common factors that affect the length of drug detox: Daily dosages of substances being used Lifespan of the addiction Frequency of drug use Patient’s age, weight, and nutrition Co-occurring mental health disorders FREE INSURANCE VERIFICATION We accept most insurances, call us to find out for certain.Choosing an Amphetamine Detox Center in Ohio Amphetamine abuse practices naturally breed uncomfortable withdrawal effects along the way.

      Once the symptoms are gone it means that physically they are no longer dependent on the drug because they have flushed the chemicals and toxins from their body. Sometimes the person may also experience emotional and mental depression. 
      In effect, amphetamines cause widespread damage to the mind and body, making it increasingly difficult to function in daily life. An opiate user isn’t technically required to be medically supervised, however, an opiate user will very rarely stay through the entire withdrawal process without the aid of other drugs to alleviate the uncomfortable symptoms.
